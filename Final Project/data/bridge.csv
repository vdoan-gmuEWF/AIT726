Acoustic Emission (AE),"Bridge - Acoustic Emission (AE)Target of InvestigationAE technology is typically applied to steel bridges to monitor existing cracks or detect the development of cracks at a particular location on the structure. AE technology can also be applied to monitor a retrofit that is intended to arrest cracks or stop new fatigue cracks from developing. AE technology can be applied to detect and monitor cracks in the following elements:Steel girders.Truss members.Pin and hanger assemblies.Eyebars.Figure 1 shows AE sensors mounted on a steel girder to detect the development of cracks in the weld between the web and diaphragm.Figure 1. Photo. AE Sensors Mounted on a Steel Girder.AE signals released from cracks developing in the weld and are detected by the sensors. Sensors are connected to a data acquisition system that detects AE events and identifies events resulting from crack initiation.DescriptionAE technology uses NDE techniques for detecting, locating, and monitoring fatigue cracks in steel bridges. AE can be used on a wide variety of metal structures, including airframes, pipelines, and pressure vessels. AE is implemented by mounting one or more acoustic sensors on the surface of the material being tested to detect transient elastic waves produced by the evolution of damage in the material; for example, when a crack increases in length due to the application of load, acoustic waves are produced. These waves spread through the material and are detected by the acoustic sensors mounted on the surface. The waveform signals detected by the acoustic sensor(s) are analyzed to determine the rate at which AE signals produced from damage evolution are occurring. This analysis helps locate the damage and estimate the rate at which the damage is progressing.AE signals are produced by the progression of damage such as the increase in length of a fatigue crack; therefore, loading must be applied to cause the damage to progress. For crack detection in highway bridges, a structure is monitored over time as traffic loads are applied to the bridge, which may result in crack growth. If a fatigue crack is not increasing in length, AE signals generally are not produced. Consequently, AE is not an effective method for detecting arrested cracks or other damage not progressing under load application.The position of the AE source can be found by triangulating based on the arrival time of the acoustic waves and the wave velocity in the material. Additional sensors may be employed as “guard” sensors to detect AE signals generated from sources outside an area of interest.AE technology is commonly used to monitor crack growth in steel bridges or determine if a retrofit intended to arrest cracking has been successful. AE can also be used to detect a crack that is progressing; for example, AE may be used to monitor a structural detail that is susceptible to crack growth to detect the development of a new crack.Physical PrincipleAE is an NDE technique that is used to detect damage in materials by analyzing acoustic signals produced from cracks and other defects. AE is defined as the rapid release of energy in the form of a transient elastic stress wave generated by an acoustic source. Crack growth, crack fretting, and corrosion act as acoustic sources during damage evolution, producing transient elastic waves (i.e., acoustic waves). The acoustic waves can be detected by placing sensors on the surface of the material. Figure 2 illustrates the principles of AE schematically. A stimulus, such as an applied load, results in increasing damage in the material such as the extension of a crack. When the crack extension occurs, one or more bursts of waves are released and propagate through the material. A sensor placed on the surface of the material detects the acoustic wave and records the waveform signal for analysis. The waveform signals are analyzed to detect the progression of damage in the material.(1,2,3)Figure 2. Illustration. AE Sensors Mounted on a Compact Tension Specimen and Connected to an AE Data Acquisition System with the Typical AE Waveform Parameters.Data AcquisitionEquipment for conducting AE monitoring consists of acoustic sensors, data acquisition electronics, and a computer to analyze the data. Signals received from each sensor are digitized and analyzed with a computer system using specialized software.Acoustic sensors are ultrasonic sensors in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz frequency range with integrated preamplifiers. The integrated preamplifiers are required to detect the AE waveforms produced from damage in the material because the acoustic signals are very low in amplitude.Figure 3. Composite Graph.AE Monitoring Scheme.Data ProcessingRecorded waveforms are analyzed to determine if the source of the waveform is damage or simply ambient noise caused by non-relevant noise sources, such as friction between surfaces, the movement of bolted connection or bearings, etc. Parameters of the waveform are determined as a means of discriminating noise from relevant AE signals. For example, figure 3 shows a typical AE waveform. Parameters that describe this waveform include the amplitude of the wave, the rise time, the total energy in the wave packet, and the number and duration of “counts” or wave cycles recorded that exceeded a certain threshold. Other parameters, such as the frequency characteristics of the waveform and geometric shape of the wave packets, may also be used. These parameters are then used to discriminate between acoustic waves corresponding to damage evolution and ambient noise. Waveforms that correspond to damage evolution are called “AE events.”(2)Data InterpretationThe rate of occurrence of AE events is interpreted to identify AE sources in the material, i.e. damage.  The location of the source of the AE signal is also used in the interpretation of results. For example, a high number of AE events emanating from a particular location in a structure during the application of loads may be interpreted to indicate damage at that location. The rate of AE events generally increases when damage increases. The increase in AE activity is interpreted as an indication that the damage is increasing. For example, as a crack grows as a result of applied loads, the number of AE events increases. The rate of increase in length can be estimated from the rate of increase in AE activity.AdvantagesCan be used to monitor large areas of a structure.Can detect crack growth and estimate crack growth rates.Can be used to monitor complex geometries where other NDE technology may be ineffective.Can be used to monitor for damage located in inaccessible areas.LimitationsComplex data interpretation. Acoustic signals can result from many sources in addition to a crack or defect.Can only detect increasing damage (for example, a crack that is growing).ReferencesAmerican Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) Handbook, 3rdEdition, Vol.6, pp. 32, 2005.Gostautas, R., Steel Bridge Testing Program (Interim report) “Evaluation of an Acoustic Emission Inspection System”  submitted by Physical Acoustics Corporation to FHWA NDE,December, 2008.Huang, M., Jiang, L., Liaw, K.P., Brooks, R.C., Seeley, R. and Klarstrom, L.D., “Using Acoustic Emission in Fatigue and Fracture Materials Research,” The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society, 1998."
Acoustic Tomography,"Bridge - Acoustic TomographyTarget of investigationsAcoustic tomography is beneficial in detecting the deteriorated regions of wood members.DescriptionFirst developed for inspecting urban trees, acoustic tomography has also been used for inspecting in-service wood members such as columns and piles. Compared to the other nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, acoustic tomography provides a more detailed assessment of the internal condition of wood members by providing two-dimensional (2D) images of a member’s cross section.(1)Physical PrincipleTomographic inversion involves creating 2D images of a member cross section (representing the distribution of velocity) by using the stress wave data from multiple transmitters and receivers attached to the sides of the member. The technique uses acoustic impulse as the energy source, and it commonly estimates the time of flight (TOF) to assess the wave velocity along multipaths between transmitters and receivers. TOF is the time it takes for an acoustic wave to travel between transmitter and receiver. Because the wave velocity is directly related to the density and elastic properties of wood, the areas with lower velocities can indicate the deteriorated regions of wood members.(1)The frequency of stress waves, distance between sensors, and type of algorithm used to construct the tomographic images can affect the accuracy of acoustic tomography in identifying deteriorated regions.(1)For the TOF measurements, acoustic tomography commonly uses 8–12 sensors to obtain images with sufficient resolution (figure 1). For higher resolution images, 24–36 sensors may be required. The sensors are typically connected to members using pins or nails, and a steel hammer strikes them sequentially to generate acoustic waves. In ultrasonic tomography, piezoelectric transducers attached to wood members using gel-type couplant are used to generate and receive stress waves. For field applications, a flexible mounting frame can facilitate the sensor installment and testing.(2)Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest ServiceA. Sensor Arrangement.Note: Straight lines represent the sound paths when location 1 is the transmitter and the rest of the locations are receivers.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.B. Sensor attachment.Figure 1. Photo and schematic. Acoustic tomography test of a timber post: (a) sensor arrangement and paths of acoustic waves in a round timber,(1)(b) sensor attachment.(2)Data AcquisitionThe acoustic tomography equipment generally involves a series of low-noise piezoelectric sensors, cables, tape, or caliper to measure the member dimension and distance between sensor locations, pins for attaching sensors, an amplifier, steel hammer, rechargeable batteries, and processing software. Depending on the number of sensors used during the test and the accessibility of the test location, scanning of a member cross section can take between 20–30 min.(1)The test procedure is as follows:Identify the test location, and measure its circumference using a tape measure.Determine the number of sensors to be used.Mark the starting point (sensor number one) at a test location, and use a tape measure to mark the position of sensors around the cross section.Drive the attachment pins into the wood member using a hammer, and attach the piezoelectric sensors to the pins. Insert spiked sensors directly into a wood member.Measure the distances between the sensors, and enter the measured data into the software.Start the test by tapping sensors sequentially with a steel hammer starting from sensor number one to generate stress waves.The software produces a 2D color tomogram showing the geometry of the cross section and the distribution of TOF values (figure 2).Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 2. Photo and contour map. Cross section and acoustic tomography of a timber member at the Imperial Palace in Beijing, China(1)Data ProcessingThe TOF data are analyzed in the acoustic tomography software to create a 2D tomogram.Data InterpretationThe 2D tomogram represents the distribution of velocities in the cross-section of wood members. The results are qualitative.AdvantagesCompared to other NDE techniques, a 2D tomogram provides a more detailed assessment of wood members.2D tomogram is useful in scanning members with large cross sections.LimitationsThe current acoustic tomography techniques are primarily based on TOF measurements, which limit the accuracy and resolution of the tomographic images obtained. They are typically sensitive to moderate- to severe state of decay rather than early-stage decay.The construction of tomograms from the TOF data is affected by the pronounced anisotropic nature of wood materials.The results are qualitative, and additional testing is recommended, such as resistance microdrilling, to obtain quantitative local information. Additional testing can confirm the condition of a wood member.RefrencesWhite, R. H., and R. J. Ross (2014). Wood and timber condition assessment manual. General Technical Report FPL-GTR-234.

Active Infrared Thermography (IRT),"Tunnel - Active Infrared Thermography (IRT)Target of InvestigationActive infrared thermography (IRT) can be used for the detection of subsurface defects in a variety of materials. Main applications of active IRT include detecting the following:Shallow delamination in concrete members.(1)Corrosion of steel members under paints.Debonding of tiles in tunnels.(2,3)Delamination in fiber-reinforced polymers.(4)Shallow utilities, honeycombing, and voids in concrete members.DescriptionUnlike passive IRT, which uses solar radiation or heat from the surrounding area, active IRT uses an external heat source to induce thermal changes in the material being tested. The heat source can be a propane heater, high-power lamp, infrared (IR) heating element, or flash lamp.(1,5)An IR camera measures IR radiation and converts such measurements into electrical signals. The detection of defects is based on measuring temperature variations on the surface of an element; these variations are caused by different thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and thermal conduction because of discontinuities in the element. Thermal images may be captured before the heating period, during the heating period, and during the cooling period. Figure 1 shows the test setup for detecting concrete delaminations in a specimen with active IRT. Areas with shallow delaminations heat up more quickly and develop surface temperatures up to several degrees higher than the surrounding areas of sound steel.(6)Source: FHWA.Figure 1. Photo. Concrete delamination detection using active IRT.Active IRT can be categorized by its applied heating function. Impulse thermography applies a short energy pulse to the measured object with high-energy flash systems. Transient thermography is similar to impulse thermography, but the energy is applied over a period of time. Transient thermography allows the use of low-cost excitation sources, such as halogen lamps or hot-air blowers. Lock-in thermography applies periodic harmonicmodulated energy to the element. The depth range can be set through the modulation frequency of the excitation source to obtain the best possible result. Compared to the transient method, measuring times needed for lock-in thermography are considerably longer.Physical PrincipleIRT is based on measuring thermal radiation emitted by structural elements (figure 2). Thermal radiation, which is in the wavelength range of 0.7–14 μm (0.028–0.55 mils) of the electromagnetic spectrum, is controlled by three main properties that influence the heat flow and distribution within a material: thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and mass density. Exposing the surface of a material to a radiant heat source, such as an IR heater, will cause an increase in surface temperature and diffusion of heat into the material to achieve thermal equilibrium. Subsurface defects, such as delamination or steel corrosion, interrupt the flow of heat. As a result, the surface temperature will be higher in the area of the defect relative to the surface temperature adjacent to the flaw. Therefore, it will cause higher radiation.© 2016 G. Washer.Figure 2. Illustration. Physical principle of active IRT.Data AcquisitionActive IRT uses radiant and fan heaters or flash and halogen lamps, thus eliminating dependence on heat from the sun or other natural heating sources. While active IRT may produce better controlled and higher quality results than passive IRT, it is used only in evaluations of smaller elements. IR cameras used for active IRT typically have the ability to capture thermal images at fixed time intervals during the course of testing. Many images are captured during heating and/or cooling of the material and stored for analysis. ASTM D4788-03,Standard Test Method for DetectingDelaminationsin Bridge Decks Using Infrared Thermography, can be used for surface preparation and other steps of data acquisition.(7)Data ProcessingAn IR thermal camera records a series of IR images or a video. Thermal images in combination with digital camera images facilitate locating potential defects and anomalies on the surface of an element. Data processing involves analyzing thermal images to identify anomalies in the material being tested. Data may be processed in several ways. Temperature anomalies may be observed in the thermal images produced following the heating of the surface. The time series data for individual pixels in the thermal image may be analyzed as shown in figure 3.(8)The amplitude and delay of the peak of this signal are a function of the depth, thickness, and spatial extent of the defect and may be further analyzed to better characterize the defect.© 2016 G. Washer.ΔT = temperature change.T°F= (T°C× 1.8) + 32.Figure 3. Graph. Surface temperature variations and thermal contrasts as a function of time.More advanced methods of processing data from active IRT tests include analyzing the slope of the heating and cooling cycle and time characteristics (i.e., phase) and frequency characteristics of the temperature decay.(9)In most cases, results of the IRT inspection are displayed as an image of part of the surface to identify flaws against the background of sound material.Data InterpretationSimilar to passive IRT, surface temperature from active IRT tests can be presented in colorcoded contour maps (figure 4). Areas with damages or defects manifest as different colors than sound areas. IR images from active IRT tests can be compared to or superimposed on regular photos to enhance the interpretation of conditions by correlating the visible damage, such as spalling on the surface, to thermal anomalies.Source: FHWA.T°F= (T°C× 1.8) + 32.Figure 4. Contour Surface temperature of tiled concrete from an active IRT test.AdvantagesAdvantages of IRT testing include the following:Temperatures can be compared directly via an image.Results are less dependent on environmental conditions at the time of the test.Data provided can be processed to infer characteristics of a defect (e.g., size, depth).Equipment setup is fast and easy.Data analysis is generally straightforward, with the inspector looking for hot spots.LimitationsLimitations of IRT testing include the following:Quality cameras are often expensive.Accurate temperature measurements are hindered by differing emissivity and reflections from other surfaces.Surface conditions (e.g., water, oil stains, or debris) can cause problems with data.Flaws deeper than 4–5 inches (10.16–12.7 cm) are difficult to detect in concrete elements.Heating large areas may be impractical, so it is used only in surveys of small areas and objects.Access to the inspection surface is required to position the heating source.Increased time is required for testing relative to conventional thermography.ReferencesMaser, K. (2004).Active Heating Infrared Thermography for Detection of Subsurface Bridge Deck Deterioration, Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC.Tanaka, H., Tottori, S., and Nihei, T.

Automated Sounding,"Bridge - Automated SoundingTarget of investigationAutomated sounding is mainly used to detect delamination in plate-like concrete structures, such as bridge decks. Depending on vendors, the system can also reveal the plate thickness of intact areas and characterize the size and depth of delaminated areas using advanced data processing algorithms.(1)This web page only covers using automated sounding systems for detecting delamination in concrete bridge decks.DescriptionAutomated sounding is similar to traditional chain-drag or hammer sounding but runs in an automated way. An automated sounding system consists of dragging chains, hammers, or steel rods as impactors and air-coupled acoustic sensors, such as microelectromechanical system microphones, for data acquisition. The system can be cart based, as shown in figure 1. The system can also be towed by a vehicle, enabling rapid, nondestructive evaluation of concrete bridge decks at approximately 20 mph (30 km/h) in lieu of complete lane closures.(2)Figure 1. Photo. A bridge inspector uses a cart-based sounding (impact echo) system on a bridge deck in Iowa.(2)Physical PrinciplePerforming chain dragging or hammer sounding on a moderate to severely delaminated area in concrete plate-like structures, where the lateral extension of the discontinuity is much larger than its depth, excites flexural oscillation from about 1 kHz–3 kHz. This oscillation is within the auditable frequency range (about 20 Hz–20 kHz) of humans and sounds “hollowly.”Data AcquisitionFor a complete test procedure for sounding, refer to ASTM Standard D4580/D4580M-12,Standard Practice for Measuring Delaminations in Concrete Bridge Decks by Sounding.(3)Before conducting the test, any accumulation of debris on the deck must be removed. The automated sounding system rolls over the bridge deck, scanning the entire surface by chain dragging or tapping with the steel rod or hammer. For hammer sounding, a time interval should be selected based on testing purposes. A shorter time interval represents a closer scanning space. Closer scanning spacings are typically used for indepth analyses, and wider spacings are generally used for condition surveys of the bridge deck.Data ProcessingData processing includes performing a spectrum analysis using the fast Fourier Transform to transform time-series sonic signals into amplitude spectrums in the frequency domain.(4)Peaks in the amplitude spectrum represent dominant frequency components in the collected data. Because data are collected continuously at the speed of the mounting vehicle, the short-time Fourier Transform can be used to generate a spectrogram that has both frequency and time information. With a known moving speed of the vehicle, the time axis can be mapped to the longitudinal length of the scanning area.Noises may exist in the collected data. A field test report from the Nebraska DOT showed that traffic noises did not affect the test because their frequency amplitudes are only 10 percent of that represented in a delaminated area.(4)Still, careful examinations are needed to identify and filter out noises from the measuring system. The same report showed that a noticeable level of noise around 15 kHz was caused by clapping between chain links.Data InterpretationWhen a concrete plate is in its intact condition, the thickness mode of the plate dominates the collected signal, and a clear ringing sound will be heard. The frequency of the thickness mode corresponds to the zero-group-velocity frequency of theS1Lamb mode, which depends on the plate thickness, concrete material, and Poisson’s ratio.(5)In shallow delaminated areas, flexural oscillation with a frequency lower than the thickness mode dominates the sonic signal, and a dull or hollow sound is emitted. This acoustic characteristic can help identify delaminated areas. Results are often described in contour maps that mark out delaminated areas, as shown in figure 2. More laboratory and field-testing results may be found in these reports.(6,7)© 2022 Bridge Diagnostics, Inc. (BDI).Figure 2. Graphic. Sample contour map that marks out delaminated areas.AdvantagesAgrees with the manual-sounding results but runs much faster.Eliminates a complete lane closure of the system if towed by a vehicle.Identifies severe to moderate delamination that reasonably agrees with manual sounding.Enables data storage for further investigation.LimitationsModerate to significant expertise and training is required for equipment setup and data collection, processing, and interpretation.Careful noise analysis and filtering is typically required.Special analysis is needed for delamination detection on decks with asphalt overlays.ReferencesHajin, C., S.

Coring,"Bridge - CoringTarget of investigationsCoring with an increment borer is considered the most dependable technique for investigating internal decay and estimating the age of a tree.(1,2)This approach results in small diameter (i.e., 0.169 inch) but relatively long (i.e., 10 inch) cores.The cylindrical core sample is another type of core not discussed in this document which has a larger diameter but shorter length (approximately 2 inches). Cores are typically used to determine moisture content, specific gravity, and type of species and grade when performing a bridge load rating analysis. Cores are extracted using a portable drill and a specialized drill bit. Treated wood plugs are then glued into the holes after the core is removed.DescriptionThrough examining a solid sample from a questionable member, coring enables identification of the presence of voids, the depth of preservative penetration and retention, and the type of wood species.Physical PrincipleCoring involves the visual inspection of a solid sample from a suspect member to investigate the presence of defects, depth of decay, depth of preservative penetration, or type of wood speciesData AcquisitionThe incremental borer is a precision instrument consisting of three parts: handle, auger, and extractor (figure 1). An operator uses the handle to apply torque to the auger, which is threaded at its tip for cutting into the wood. After cutting, the core sample is handled by the extractor. The borers are available in various lengths between 4 inches (100 mm) and 28 inches (700 mm), in 2‑inch (50 mm) increments.(3)The borers are also available in two-thread and three-thread designs. A two-thread design cuts at a slower speed and, thus, it is more appropriate for cutting into hardwood. On the other hand, a three-thread design cuts at a faster rate and is more appropriate for softwood. The common internal diameters of the borer (which determines the width of the core) are 0.169 inch (4.35 mm) and 0.2 inch (5.15 mm), although 0.32 inch (8 mm), 0.4 inch (10 mm), and 0.48 inch (12 mm) sizes are also available. The larger diameter borers require more physical effort to cut into the wood.(3)For coring, place the incremental borer at the core location, and hold the shaft of the auger with one hand while putting the other hand at the center of the handle.(3)Apply enough pressure for the auger tip to penetrate the wood member and rotate the handle. Continue rotating the handle until the auger threads are fully engaged. The hammer should not be used to force the borer to enter the wood.(3)Boring can be accomplished using both hands and at half-turn (better for hardwood) or full-turn (better for softwood) rotations. At the start of boring, keep the handle as steady as possible without wobbling to the sides to obtain a straight core.(3)When the desired core length is achieved, insert the extractor with a flash and move all the way into the auger. Turn the handle counterclockwise for one or two full turns to separate the core from the rest of the wood, and then pull the extractor. The core can be stored in a tube, such as a paper or plastic straw, where one end is closed, and straws should be labeled with a pen or marker.After coring, the borer may be removed from the wood by turning the handle counterclockwise. If the auger is not engaged with the wood, the handle should be pulled and turned to remove the incremental borer.Boring tools should be cleaned after extracting each core to avoid transferring microorganisms.(1)The bored-out holes should be filled with wood plugs treated with preservatives such as copper naphthalene.(2)When stored, the borer components should be lubricated to prevent the corrosion of components.(3)Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest ServiceFigure 1. Photo. Boring a core from a timber pile.(2)Data ProcessingNo data processing is requiredData InterpretationAn inspector performs a visual inspection of cores to confirm the presence of decay, depth of preservative penetration, and type of wood species.AdvantagesSome advantages to coring are as follows:Coring is low cost.Coring provides solid samples from the subsurface of wood members.LimitationsLimitations with coring include the following:Coring can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.Coring does not provide quantitative information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood members unless mechanical testing is performed on the core samples.Training is required for coring.ReferencesRyan, T.

Crack Propagation Gage (CPG),"Bridge - Crack Propagation Gage (CPG)Target of InvestigationCPGs are applied to monitor the extension of a crack in steel girders, eyebars, and truss members. Cracks detected using other methods, such as visual inspection, can be monitored with the gages to evaluate if the crack is growing. Fatigue cracks in a steel girder can be monitored with CPGs to monitor the rate at which the crack is growing as a result of the applied loading.CPGs can also be used to monitor localized areas of a structure where cracking is likely to develop. In this way, the gage can be used as a crack detection tool that monitors the area continuously to determine if a crack develops.DescriptionA CPG consists of a series of conductive tracks etched on a polymer substrate.  The gage is bonded to the surface of a specimen in the area of the crack tip such that growth of the crack will result in individual tracks in the gage being fractured, affecting the resistance of the gage.Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of two CPGs mounted on the surface of an eyebar. The gages are mounted on the eyebar head in the area where cracks initiating at the bore of the eyebar would be expected to grow through the eyebar head. In this way, the gage acts as a crack detection sensor that produces a resistance change if a crack develops in the area under the gage.Figure 1. Illustration. Two CPGs Mounted on an Eyebar Head to Detect Cracks Initiating at the Bore of the Eyebar.CPGs are available is a variety of different sizes and shapes. For example, gages with circular or semi-circular shapes are produced for monitoring cracks initiating at bolt holes. Rectangular-shaped gages (figure 2) are available in a variety of different sizes and are typically used for monitoring cracks in plates. Gages are bonded to the surface using an adhesive. Surface preparation is required to ensure sufficient bonding between the gage and the surface such that crack growth will result fracture of the conductive tracks.Figure2. Photo. A Crack Propagation Gage Bonded to the Surface of a Specimen to Monitor the Growth of a Crack.Physical PrincipleCPGs are used to measure the growth of a surface-breaking crack. The sensor consists of a pattern of conductive tracks etched on a non-conductive polymer substrate. The gage is bonded to the specimen surface at the tip of a crack (figure 3). When the crack length increases, the individual tracks in the sensor gage are fractured, causing the resistance of the gage to increase. A simple voltage or resistance measurement across the terminals on the gage indicates the number of tracks that are fractured, and these changes are interpreted to determine the crack growth.(1)Figure 3. Illustration. Crack Propagation Gage Placement.Data AcquisitionThe data produced by a CPG is a voltage or resistance measurement based on the resistance of the gage. The resistance of the gage increases when individual conductive tracks are fractured by a crack propagating across the gage. Instrumentation to read a CPG can be as simple as an ohmmeter with milliohm sensitivity to measure the resistance of the gage directly. Common data acquisition systems can also be used to monitor the voltage output of the gage. Data is typically collected during a long time intervals, such as weeks or even years, depending on the anticipated rate of crack growth. CPGs can be installed on a permanent basis to monitor an area where cracks are anticipated. Figure 4 illustrates the typical output of a CPG. The gage pattern shown has six individual conductive tracks extending between terminals at each end. Voltage or resistance measurements across these terminals indicate the number of tracks that have fractured. As the crack propagates in the material being tested, the conductive tracks of the CPG are fractured, resulting in an increase in the resistance between the terminals on the gage.Figure 4. Graph. Resistance Changes in a CPG as a Result of Crack Propagation.Data ProcessingA CPG produces a voltage or resistance that changes as a result of crack propagation, therefore little data processing is required.Data InterpretationThe data produced from a CPG is a change in the resistance of the gage, interpreted to determine the length of crack extension.AdvantagesLow cost.Simple application.Easy data interpretation.Provides continuous monitoring of crack growth.LimitationsCracks must be surface breaking.Requires surface access.Requires surface preparation.ReferencesASTM,Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fatigue Crack Growth Rates, E647-13ae1, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2013."
Displacement Gauge (DG),"Bridge - Displacement Gauge (DG)Target of InvestigationA displacement gauge can be used to measure the following:Absolute displacement or deflection of a structural surface from a reference surface or the ground.Relative displacement of two surfaces.DescriptionA displacement gauge is used to measure the distance between an object and a reference position. Displacement gauges manufactured based on different physical principles can have different measuring ranges, accuracies, and usage environments to serve applications with different purposes.Measurements using displacement gauges can be classified into two broad categories: noncontact measurements using light or sound waves and contact measurements performed in direct contact with the target.(1)Figure 1 shows an example using contact-type displacement sensors to measure the crack opening of a concrete structure under load.(2)Source: FHWA.Figure 1. Photo. Displacement sensors used to measure crack openings.(2)Physical PrincipleDisplacement gauges have been developed based on different physical principles. The noncontact type of displacement gauge is usually developed based on propagation and reflection of light or sound waves. For example, displacement may be measured based on the two-way travel time of either ultrasonic waves or laser beams. Displacement may also be based on the principle of triangulation to detect the difference in position of reflected laser beams on the light-receiving element. Figure 2 shows the physical principle of noncontact displacement sensors using twoway travel time. Other noncontact displacement gauges use different physical principles. For example, eddy current–based displacement sensors measure voltage changes as a result of changes in the interaction of the magnetic field owing to different distances between the probe and target.Source: FHWA.d= distance between sensor and structural surface;v= speed of sound waves;Δt= two-way travel time of signal.Figure 2. Illustration. Physical principle of noncontact displacement measurement using ultrasound.Contact-type displacement gauges usually convert displacements between the two anchorages of the gauge to either an electrical or mechanical signal (spring force). For example, figure 3 shows the physical principle of a linear variable differential transformer, which converts displacement to an electrical voltage. The movable soft iron core is attached to the measured surface by the arm. The device is attached to the reference surface. An alternating current (AC) voltage is supplied to the primary winding. Two voltages,VS1andVS2, are obtained at the two secondary windings.Vd, the output voltage between the two secondary windings, is the difference betweenVS1andVS2and linearly related to the displacement of the soft iron core. Other contact types of displacement gauges can be developed based on different physical principles.Source: FHWA.Figure 3.

Physical principle of a linear voltage differential transformer.Data AcquisitionData gathered by a displacement gauge can include two-way travel time, voltage, resistance, or mechanical force or moment. Data acquisition systems that capture signals from a displacement gauge can be an interferometer interrogator, ohmmeter with milliohm sensitivity to measure the resistance of the gauge, or dial gauge. Displacement gauges can be installed on a permanent basis to monitor an area where differential settlement is anticipated.Data ProcessingA displacement gauge produces a voltage/resistance, light signal, or force/moment, which changes as a result of changing displacement. The change can be converted to the displacement by a calibration factor. Thus, little data processing is required.Data InterpretationThe measured displacement can be used to determine if the displacement between the target surface and the reference surface is within the acceptable limits.AdvantagesAdvantages of displacement gauges include the following:Simple application.Easy data interpretation.Continuous monitoring of a displacement.LimitationsLimitations of displacement gauges include the following:Requires surface access for contact measurement.Requires surface preparation for contact measurement.ReferencesKEYENCE. “What are Displacement Sensors (Displacement Gauges) and Dimension Measurement Systems?” (website) Itasca, IL. Available online:https://www.keyence.com/ss/products/measure/measurement_library/basic/products_info/, last accessed October 4, 2018.Federal Highway Administration. (2016). “Design Guide for Precast UHPC Waffle Deck Panel System, including Connections.” (website) Washington, DC. Available online:https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hfl/partnerships/uhpc/hif13032/chap01.cfm, last accessed August 2, 2018."
Drilling,"Bridge - DrillingTarget of investigationsDrilling can provide information about the internal decay, voids, the residual shell thickness in wood members.DescriptionDrilling is a direct technique to evaluate the presence of subsurface defects. When inspectors drill into a suspect member, they can feel the resistance against drilling if a hand crank drill is used and monitor the drilling shaving. Nowadays, large drill bits (i.e., 3/8 inch to 3/4 inch) are rarely used to drill through timber bridge elements due to their destructive nature. Drilling usually leaves a sizeable hole and sometimes extends entirely through members. It has largely been replaced with the resistance microdrilling technique, which is less subjective and minimally destructive.Physical PrincipleAn inspector performs the visual inspection of drill shaving related to the presence of decay or void. Using a hand crank drill, the inspector can feel the resistance against drilling, which is proportional to the wood density.(1)The low-density regions can suggest the presence of decay or void. By feeling a sudden drop in the resistance against drilling and visually inspecting drill shaving, an inspector can confirm the presence of decay or void in wood members.Data AcquisitionWhile an electric power drill can be faster, a hand crank drill allows an inspector to feel resistance as he or she drills, which can help estimate the decay depth and shell thickness. Drill bits with a diameter of 3/8 inch to 3/4 inch are commonly used. When drilling, an inspector monitors wood shavings for potential decay and notes areas where drilling is easier. The growth features of wood, such as resin pockets and knots, should not be interpreted as deteriorated regions. After drilling, shell thickness can be estimated using a bent wire or thickness gauge inserted into the drilled hole.(1)Copper naphthalene should be applied to the decayed area to retard the decay progress. Precautions should be taken to avoid spillage into the environment surrounding the bridge. The drill hole should be filled with a wood dowel soaked in preservatives.(1)The drill bits should also be cleaned to avoid the transfer of microorganisms. For drilling vertical faces, drill at a slightly upward angle for drainage to flow away from the filled hole.(2)The common areas for drilling are the ones more susceptible to moisture accumulation and decay, such as the following:(2)Deck planks at the bottom next to beams.Beams in the sides near the deck and at the bottom close to the pile/bent cap.Cap on the top near beams and at the bottom close to the piles/bents.Pile/bent on the top near the cap and at the bottom near the waterline or ground level.Data ProcessingNo data processing is requiredData InterpretationAn inspector marks areas of the wood where drilling is easier.AdvantagesThere are many advantages to drilling, including the following:SimpleLow costSamples obtained from the subsurface of wood members.LimitationsDrilling can be subjective and is a destructive technique using drill bits ranging from 3/8 inch to 3/4 inch diameter.Drilling can be time-consuming and labor-intensive depending on the number of tests.Drilling does not provide quantitative information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood members.ReferencesWhite, R.

Dye Penetrant Testing (DPT),Sorry! That page can’t be found.
Eddy Current Array Testing (ECA),"Bridge - Eddy Current Array Testing (ECA)Target of InvestigationThe eddy-current array testing method is used to inspect conductive objects to detect surface or near-surface defects. It has a variety of industrial applications, such as in the aerospace and petrochemical industries. ECA is very flexible, and a wide range of specimen shapes can be inspected. For bridge structures, ECA is carried out on ferromagnetic steel welds to inspect for defects and can be used for testing over typical bridge paints. ECA can also be used to estimate geometric parameters such as lift-off, coating thicknesses, and other dependent properties such as stress, related to either magnetic permeability or electrical conductivity, and temperature, related to electrical conductivity.(1)DescriptionThe ECA is a newer technology that extends the principle of conventional eddy current testing (ET). ECA systems are generally made of a conformable eddy current array specifically designed for model-based inverse methods. Multivariate inverse methods convert the sensor response into absolute property estimates. Multiple sensor responses for each individual sensing element at each location are converted into estimates of several material properties at each location along the inspected surface of the material.Physical PrincipleECA is conceptually similar to conventional ET. For conventional ET, eddy currents are induced when an energized probe-coil is placed near the surface of a conductive material; ECA extends this concept and uses an array of multiple coils instead of only a single coil.  The coil current must be alternating current (AC) since a time-dependent magnetic field is required to induce or generate electrical currents. The eddy currents induced at the surface of the test material are time varying and have magnitude and phase. Eddy currents are proportional to the electrical conductivity of the material. Material properties and discontinuities such as cracks disturb the eddy current trajectories, affecting the magnitude and phase of the induced current. The coils sense the magnetic field induced by these currents, producing a complex voltage in the coils.Data AcquisitionSensor arrays are fabricated on a thin flexible printed circuit board substrate. This allows sensors to conform to the shape of a specimen. Data acquisition consists of electronics to drive sensor arrays and measure the response of the individual array coils (figures 1 and 2).Sensor arrays can measure multiple quantities, such as lift-off (distance from the array coil to the specimen), permeability, and other material properties. Sensor coils can be incorporated with encoders to measure the movement of the coils and correlate measured data with spatial position on a specimen. Equipment is generally designed for laboratory and industrial applications.Figure 1. Photo. Technician Performing Inspection with Eddy Current Array.Figure 2. Photo. Eddy Current Array Instrument and Sensor.Data ProcessingData processing is done internally within the instrument hardware and software. System software uses calibrated look-up tables to relate measured signals to desired physical parameters. With the use of position encoders, data can be presented with a spatial reference. Data can be stored for offline processing and provides a permanent record.Data InterpretationData is interpreted by the operator while using the device. Signal output is observed on the instrument display and the operator uses judgment to determine the meaning of the signal. Operating equipment and interpreting data requires significant skill for an operator. Figure 3 shows sample ECA testing results for estimating lift-off and magnetic permeability.Figure 3. Contour Maps. Data Output showing Lift-Off (left) and Permeability (right).Signal output can be dependent on the movement of the probe over the specimen surface. Irregular surfaces or inconsistent movement of a probe (e.g., lifting the probe off the surface or tilting the probe) can produce signals that could be interpreted as defects. Skilled operators can consistently scan specimens and apply judgment as to the nature of the output signal.AdvantagesCan detect near-surface defects through paint.Provides a C-scan type of image of a defect.Can measure multiple physical parameters.Can compensate for lift-off and material property variations better than conventional eddy current.LimitationsResults influenced by magnetic properties of weld materials.Results affected by probe orientation during scanning.Requires operator experience and skill.Costly equipment.Limited use in difficult access areas due to probe size.ReferencesASTM,Standard Guide for Eddy Current Testing of Electrically Conducting Materials Using Conformable Sensor Arrays, E2884-13e1, ASTM International, Conshohcken, PA, 2013."
Eddy Current Testing (ECT),"Bridge - Eddy Current Testing (ECT)Target of InvestigationECT is used to detect cracks in steel bridge members. Due to the magnetic properties of steel, only surface breaking or near surface-breaking cracks can be detected. The technology can be effective for detecting cracks in welds; however, special probes must be used due to complex magnetic and microstructural properties associated with the weld and the surrounding heat affected zone (HAZ).DescriptionECT works by scanning a small electromagnetic probe across the surface of a material. The signal produced by the probe is displayed in real-time on an instrument screen, and changes in the signals are produced when the probe scans across a discontinuity in the material. Inspectors interpret the changes in the signal produced by the probe to identify cracks or other defects.The ECT method is used to inspect conductive materials to detect surface or near-surface cracks. ECT is used to detect cracks in a wide variety of metal components, such as airplane landing gear, turbine engines, heat exchanger tubing, pipes, and rods. For bridges, ECT is applied to detect surface-breaking cracks in steel components.Physical PrincipleThe basic principle of ECT is to induce electrical currents in a conductive material and analyze perturbations in the current flow caused by discontinuities in the material. The induced currents flow in a circular pattern and are referred to aseddy currents. Eddy currents are generated by a probe consisting of one or more wire coils excited with alternating currents at a regulated frequency. This results in a dynamic expanding and collapsing magnetic field surrounding the coil. When an electrically conductive material is placed within the magnetic field, eddy currents are induced in the material through electromagnetic induction. The currents flowing in the material create a secondary magnetic field that opposes the primary magnetic field of the coil, affecting the impedance of the coil. The presence of a discontinuity, defect, or irregularity in the grain structure of the material disrupts the flow of the current in the material; therefore, changes in the impedance of the coil are produced. Impedance changes in the coil are analyzed and interpreted to detect defects in the material.Probes must be oriented such that a crack is perpendicular to the flow of current in the material and the crack interrupts the current flow. Current flow in the material is parallel to the flow of current in the probe coil with current flow in the opposite direction. In other words, the path of current at the surface of the material is an “image” of the coil with opposing current direction.The sensitivity of eddy current inspection depends on the eddy current density at the flaw location. Eddy current density decreases with increasing depth into the material under test due to the skin effect. The depth of penetration decreases with increasing frequency, conductivity, and magnetic permeability.The density of currents in a conductive material can be described by the standard depth of penetration equation (figure 1), which determines the depth into the material at which the density of current is reduced to 1/e (i.e., ~37 percent) relative to the density at the surface.Figure 1. Equation. Standard Depth of Penetration.Where:d =  skin depth of penetration (mm).f=  excitation frequency (Hz).m = magnetic permeability (H/mm).s = electrical conductivity (%IACS).IACS = International Annealed Copper Standard.When attempting to locate flaws, a frequency is selected that places the expected flaw depth within one standard depth of penetration into the material; this ensures the density of current in the material is sufficient to affect the impedance of the coil and produce a flaw indication. For ferromagnetic materials (e.g., steel), permeability values are high; as a result, the standard skin depth is very small, typically less than 1-3 mm depending on the frequency used. ECT in steel can detect only surface-breaking cracks or near surface-breaking cracks. Non-ferromagnetic materials (e.g., aluminum) have a relative permeability of approximately 1 mm; therefore, skin depths are larger and subsurface flaws may be detected.ECT is sometimes used to determine the conductivity of materials or to differentiate one metal from another based on the electrical properties of the material. For this application, the test frequency is often set such that three times the standard skin depth calculated from the preceding equation is less than the thickness of the material. This ensures the material boundaries will not affect the ECT because current density is reduced to 1/e3(~5 percent) in the area of the boundary.The density of current in the material depends on the intensity of the magnetic field inducing the current. Magnetic fields attenuate exponentially in air, such that the distance from the probe coil to the surface of the material under test is an important test parameter. This effect is referred to as the “lift-off factor”—the loss in signal strength resulting from the distance between the probe coil and the surface of the material under test. In general, uniform and very small lift-off values are preferred for achieving better detection sensitivity to flaws. For steel bridges, coating on the steel causes lift-off of the sensor, decreasing signal intensity relative to uncoated steel. This affect can be mitigated by proper calibration that includes similar lift-off of the probe from the surface of the material.(1,2)Data AcquisitionData acquisition for ECT includes an ECT instrument and an appropriate hand-held probe. Relatively low cost, battery-operated portable instruments are available that make the technology practical for use on bridges (figure 2). Test results are displayed on the ECT instrument in real-time for interpretation in the field.ECT probes are produced in a variety of configurations suitable for different applications.  Several typical probes are shown in figure 3. Probes with right-angle heads are designed for inspecting the inside of bolt holes (figure 3, left). For example, very small probes are designed for applications where access is limited (figure 3, center). For inspection of welds, a differential probe with two probe coils is typically used (figure 3, right) that reduces the effect of material property variations on the probe output.Figure 2. Photo. ECT Instrument.Figure 3. Photo. ECT Probes.Data ProcessingMinimal data processing is required for ECT because the impedance signal is analyzed directly to detect cracks. Analog frequency and time-based filters are commonly used to improve signal quality.Data InterpretationAn operator completes the interpretation of data from ECT in real-time during an inspection. The signal output is analyzed as the probe is scanned across the surface of the material. The signal is analyzed to determine if signal variations represent a relevant indication, such as a crack, or if signal variations represent non-relevant indications, such as probe lift off, non-crack surface irregularities, or material property variations.Data are plotted using an impedance plane display or a time series display. An impedance plane display plots the individual components of the impedance signal (reactance and resistance) asx–ycoordinates. A time series display plots the individual components of the impedance separately against a time, sample number, or distance axis. Figure 4 shows an example of a time series display in which the probe resistance is plotted against a distance axis. The signal shown in figure 4 results from scanning the probe over a specimen with three EDM notches of different depths, and illustrates the signal displacement observed by the operator as the probe is scanned across each notch. Figure 5 shows a pencil ECT probe being used to inspect the web of a girder.Figure 4. Graph. ECT Signal with Defect Indications.Figure 5. Digital photo. A Pencil Probe (ECT) Placed on Web of a Girder to Detect Defects.Signal output can be dependent on the movement of the probe over the specimen surface.  Irregular surfaces or inconsistent movement of a probe (e.g., lifting the probe off the surface or tilting the probe) can produce signals that may be interpreted as defects. Skilled operators can consistently scan specimens and use judgment to determine the nature of the output signal.AdvantagesLow-cost, portable instrumentation.Minimal surface preparation.Does not require coating removal like other crack detection technologies such as dye penetrant testing (PT), ultrasonics (UT), or magnetic particle testing (MT).Can detect paint thickness variations.LimitationsDetects only surface-breaking cracks.Magnetic properties of weld materials can influence results.Method requires skill by the operator in order to obtain reliable results.ReferencesAmerican Society of Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) Handbook, 3rdEdition, Vol. 5, 2005.Hagemaier, J.D.,Fundamentals of Eddy Current Testing,December, 1990."
Electrical Resistivity (ER),"Pavements - Electrical Resistivity (ER)Target of InvestigationElectrical resistivity (ER) testing is used to characterize the corrosive nature of steel reinforced–concrete structures, including reinforced concrete pavement. It is primarily employed for the following applications:Characterizing the susceptibility of reinforced concrete to corrosion.Identifying concrete sections susceptible to moisture or chloride penetration.ER measurement can also be used to complement other nondestructive evaluations that assess corrosion, such as half-cell potential (HCP), which describes the probability of corrosion activity.(1)ER cannot be used with electrically isolating surface layers, such as asphalt pavements or asphalt overlays on concrete pavements.Research has been conducted on applications of ER, such as measuring thickness of pavements, indicating chloride permeability (surface resistivity), determining the depth of frost penetration, and monitoring the infiltration of water into a pavement section using electrical resistance thermography.(2–5)These applications were all found to be too undeveloped or unrefined for use in the field.DescriptionThe presence and concentrations of water and chlorides are important parameters when characterizing a corrosive environment in reinforced concrete.(1)ER is an effective method for assessing the susceptibility of reinforced concrete to this corrosive environment.(6)Damaged and cracked areas resulting from increased porosity become preferential paths for fluid and ion flow, creating an environment conducive to corrosion. Conductive environment allows a current to pass between anodic and cathodic sites on the steel reinforcement. The higher the ER value of a concrete, the lower this current will be.(1)As such, low ER values are indicative of an environment that supports corrosion and typically leads to high corrosion rates.(6)The ER measurement system usually consists of a four-electrode Wenner probe and a data acquisition device (figure 1). Measurements are taken by pressing the probe against a damp concrete surface; the ER value displayed on the probe itself or an attached device (e.g., a tablet) is recorded.(6)Figure 2 shows an ER measurement being taken in the field.Source: FHWA.A. Top view.Figure 1. Photos. Four-point Wenner probe.Source: FHWA.B. Side view.Source: FHWA.Figure 2. Photo. Conducting ER measurement.Physical PrincipleER and its reciprocal, conductivity, are properties that quantify a material’s ability to oppose and conduct, respectively, an electric current. ER is measured in units of ohm-centimeter (Ω-cm) or Ω-m in metric units and ohm-inch (Ω-inch) or microhm-inch in imperial units. Electrical conductivity in concrete systems primarily results from electrolytic current flow through open‑pore systems between the anodic and cathodic sites on a reinforcement, where damaged and cracked areas become preferential paths for fluid and ion flow.(7)Surface ER measurements of a steel reinforced–concrete structure can be used to characterize the corrosive environment of the concrete. Voltage and current are measured at the surface of the concrete using a Wenner probe (figure 3).(1)Four equally spaced electrodes are galvanically connected to the concrete using a wet sponge on each electrode. A current is applied through the concrete between the two outer electrodes, and the potential of the generated electrical field is measured between the two inner electrodes. The ER is then calculated using the equation shown in figure 4.© 2015 N. Gucunski, Rutgers University.Figure 3. Illustration. Physical principle of ER testing.(1)Figure 4. Equation. ER calculation.Where:ρ= ER (kΩ-cm).a= distance between electrodes (cm).V= voltage (V).I= current (A).In general, low ER measurements indicate areas where the environment is conducive to corrosion, while high ER measurements indicate areas where the environment does not facilitate corrosion. Correlations between ER values and corrosion rates of concrete are given in table 1.Table 1. Correlation between ER values and corrosion rates.(1)ER(kΩ-cm)Corrosion RateLess than 5Very high5 to 10High10 to 20Moderate to low>20Low1 kΩ-cm = 0.39 Ω-inch.Building materials—such as concrete, cement, and wood—are ion conductors, which means that electrical conduction occurs through the interconnected pore space. The resistivity of concrete affects ion current flow between the anodic and cathodic sites on the steel reinforcement that is undergoing corrosion. Dry concrete has a high resistivity that impedes this current, while highly permeable and moist concrete has a low resistivity and is conductive to corrosion currents. The ER of fully saturated concrete is approximately 1–10 Ω-cm (0.393–3.93 Ω-inches), depending on the conductivity of the saturating fluid. When concrete is oven dried, the resistivity can be as high as 100 kΩ-cm (39.3 Ω-inches) causing it to act as an insulator.(1)Since concrete is a composite material, its ER depends on its porosity, pore-size distribution, cement chemistry, water-to-cement ratio, presence of admixtures, ion type, saturation fluid, and other factors. Field ER measurements can be affected by the concrete’s surface-level moisture, carbonation, and any steel reinforcement in the vicinity of the electrodes.(1)Data AcquisitionCurrently, there is no ASTM standard for using a Wenner probe to measure the ER of a reinforced concrete structure. ASTM G57-06(2012),Standard Test Method for Field Measurement of Soil Resistivity Using the Wenner Four-Electrode Method, can serve as a guideline, but the two applications have differences.(8)The typical procedure for data collection on a reinforced concrete structure is detailed below:Identify locations or lay out a grid for data collection on the concrete surface.Ensure galvanic connection between probe electrodes and the concrete surface. Note the following:If the concrete surface is dry, prewet each test location with water, contact graphite gel, or pastes.Do not overwet the surface as it may contribute to probe-to-probe current flow along the surface.(7)Make sure sponges on the probe electrode ends are always kept wet.Place the Wenner probe against the surface with the center of the probe oriented at the test location.Record the measured ER value.Repeat for each test location.Data ProcessingData processing is not complicated and consists mostly of plotting raw data.(1)This generally produces a contour map of the measured ER displayed with the spatial distribution of the test locations (figure 5).© 2013 Rutgers CAIT.1 ft = 0.3 m; 1 kΩ-cm = 0.39 Ω-inch.Note: Arrows indicate areas with very low ER.Figure 5. Contour map. Plotted ER measurements.(1)Data InterpretationData interpretation can be challenging because the ER of a concrete depends on several material properties, including moisture content, salt content, and porosity; delineating each property’s specific contribution to the whole is difficult.(1)AdvantagesAdvantages of taking ER measurements using the Wenner probe include the following:Fairly easy-to-use system that requires little training.(7)Straightforward data processing.Reliable, precise, and accurate measurements.(7)Robust and relatively inexpensive.(7)Complementary to HCP surveys.LimitationsLimitations of taking ER measurements using the Wenner probe include the following:Unable to measure corrosion rate.Challenging, complex data interpretation because of multiple contributing factors.Potential for probe-to-probe current flow.Ineffective on electrically isolating surface layers, such as asphalt pavement and asphalt overlays.ReferencesGucunski, N., Imani, A., Romero, F., Nazarian, S., Yuan, D., Wiggenhauser, H., Shokouhi, P., Taffee, A., and Kutrubes, D.

Ground Penetrating Radar,"Bridge - Ground Penetrating RadarTarget of investigationsGround penetrating radar (GPR) is beneficial in identifying the presence of subsurface features with dielectric constants different from the rest of the wood. Features include moisture pockets, knots, voids, and metal connectors. In particular, identifying moisture pockets is of high interest as moisture is associated with, or a precursor of, decay.DescriptionGPR evaluates the condition of wood members by emitting short pulses of electromagnetic (EM) waves into the members and capturing part of the EM waves reflected from the interface of materials with different dielectric constants. The transmitter and receiver are typically placed in the same box, which enables the single-sided inspection of members.(1)Physical PrincipleAs EM waves interact with materials of different dielectric constants, part of the waves is reflected toward the surface. The amplitude of reflection is affected by the extent of the differences between the dielectric constant of medium components. For example, because the dielectric constant of metals is considered infinite, the reflected EM signal off the metal surface is quite strong. Therefore, metallic components (such as bolts) can be easily observed in the GPR scans of wood members. Furthermore, EM waves lose their energy as they travel into a material. The extent of the energy loss depends on the frequency of EM waves and the nature of the material. For example, because water tends to substantially attenuate the EM waves, the penetration depth of EM waves in wet wood is limited.Data AcquisitionUnlike common nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, GPR does not require measurements at multiple points, but rather it provides a continuous image from the internal structure of wood members. For GPR inspection, the equipment can be moved over the surface to quickly scan the area of interest.(1)While metallic bolts tend to generate strong reflections with hyperbolic shapes, a major challenge with GPR inspections is the difficulty in differentiating between different features as in figure 1.(2,1)© 2021 Rodrigues, B. P., C. A. Senalik, X. Wu, and J. Wacker.Figure 1. Graphic. A sample of GPR scan with various types of features: One and two are knots, and three is a drilled hole (to simulate void).(1)For inspecting timber members, high-frequency GPR (1.5–2.5 GHz) is commonly used, although depending on the special application, a lower frequency GPR (i.e., 900 MHz to 1 GHz) may also be used. While a higher frequency antenna provides a higher resolution of GPR scans, the depth of penetration decreases with increasing frequency. For example, in a moist wood where EM waves tend to substantially attenuate, a lower frequency antenna is preferred.(2)The depth of GPR penetration can be estimated by placing a metal plate, which acts as a strong reflector, on the far side of the member if both sides of a member are accessible.(2)The known distance of the metal plate from the antenna can also help estimate the depth of other features (i.e., voids) in GPR images. The application of GPR for condition assessment of wood members is still largely limited to the lab environment; however, some studies have applied GPR for inspection of wood in the field environment.(1)Data ProcessingProcessing of GPR data is often accomplished using software provided by the GPR vendor. When parabolic shapes are present in the scans (i.e., as in figure 1), postprocessing can be performed to assess the velocity of EM waves in a timber member. This postprocessing enables estimating the depth of features such as voids, bolts, and so on. Alternatively, the data gathered from placing a metal plate at the other side of the member (known distance from antenna) can be used to estimate the velocity of EM waves inside the member. The raw GPR output is a time-history signal, and it does not provide information about the depth of penetration.Postprocessing can also provide information about the amplitude of the signal at a certain depth and time. The postprocessing software allows exporting the amplitude of the GPR signal at multiple locations to a comma-separated value and text file.Data InterpretationThe interpretation of data often requires GPR expertise. When the desired information is obtained from postprocessing, it may be plotted in the form of contour maps. Depending on the application, raw GPR signals can also be shown where features are marked (i.e., figure 1).AdvantagesGPR has several advantages, including:Rapid continuous member scanning.(2)One-sided access.(2)Repeatable results.(2)Scanning of imperfect surfaces.(2)Identifying subsurface features, such as moisture pockets, knots, voids, and metal connectors.LimitationsPostprocessing and interpretation of data can become complicated and may require NDE expertise.Differentiating between the different subsurface features can be difficult.Detecting small defects (i.e., fine cracks) is challenging.(2)ReferencesRodrigues, B.

Half-Cell Potential (HCP),"Bridge - Half-Cell Potential (HCP)Target of InvestigationThe half-cell potential (HCP) method can be used to identify corrosion activity of steel reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures. However, the method cannot directly measure the degree of corrosion.DescriptionHCP measurement is based on the coexistence of corroding areas (or anodic half-cells) and non-corroding areas (or cathodic half-cells) on rebar. The measurement is calculated as the potential differences, or voltages, across the steel-concrete interfaces. The potential difference between a standard portable half-cell, typically a Cu/CuSO4electrode, and the reinforcing steel of a concrete element is measured.(1)When the reference electrode is moved along a line or grid on the surface of a member (figure 1), the spatial distribution of corrosion potential can be mapped. Any change in the potential between the reference electrode and the steel-concrete interface can be attributed to, among other things, the corrosion activity at the surface of the steel.Figure 1. Photo. HCP Measurements on a Concrete Deck Using a Rolling Probe.(2)The HCP measurement is a well-established and widely used electrochemical technique to evaluate active corrosion in steel reinforced and pre-stressed concrete structures.(3)HCP measurements should be taken on a clean concrete surface since presence of isolating layers (asphalt, coating, and paint) may make measurements erroneous or impossible. Using empirical comparisons, the HCP’s results can be linked to the probability of active corrosion.Physical PrincipleFigure 2 depicts the principle of the HCP method. Corrosion of steel in concrete is similar to the electrochemical mechanism of corrosion of a metal in an electrolyte. This implies that separate anodic and cathodic processes take place simultaneously on the same metal surface. At the corroding side (the anode), iron is dissolved and oxidized to iron ions, leaving electrons in the steel. At the cathodic side of the reaction, oxygen is reduced and hydroxyl ions are produced. The potential of the generated electrical field is measured by a reference electrode. The reference electrode is connected to the positive end of a voltmeter and steel reinforcement to the negative one. The reference electrode is usually galvanically coupled to the concrete surface using a wet sponge. The input impedance of the voltmeter should be in the range of 106Ω to 109Ω.Figure 2. Illustration. Principle of HCP Measurement.(3)Data AcquisitionASTM C876–09,Standard Test Method for Half-Cell Potentials of Uncoated Reinforcing Steel in Concrete, describes the HCP test method. The test procedure on a bridge deck can be summarized in the following steps:(4)Lay out a 2ft by 2ft grid on the deck.Locate the top reinforcing bar using a rebar locator (GPR or pachometer) at several points along the bridge deck. A minimum of two locations is required for every test area so that continuity of the reinforcement can be checked. However, the actual number of locations depends on the size of the bridge and the continuity of the reinforcement.Drill or core a 1 inch hole in the concrete to expose the reinforcement at each location where reinforcement has been located (figure 3).Figure 3. Photo. Drilling a Hole into the Concrete over a Shallow Bar.(2)Securely connect a lead wire to the reinforcement (figure 4).Figure 4. Photo. Lead Wire Connected to the Reinforcement by an Electrical Clip.(2)Check electrical continuity of the steel reinforcement cage between the installed lead wire locations (taps) by connecting the two taps to a standard multimeter and measuring the resistance. The reinforcement is considered continuous when the measured resistance is 1Ω or less considering the resistance of the lead wire.Securely connect the exposed steel to the reference electrode.Connect the reference electrode to the negative terminal and the steel reinforcement to the positive terminal of the high impedance voltmeter.Wet the contact sponge of the half-cell with soapy water to ensure good electrical contact with the concrete deck.If time and access allows, pre-wet the deck prior to testing.Place the reference electrode (wheel/rod) on each test point.  Once the voltage has stabilized, the measurement can be made by moving the wheel along the grid (figure 5).Figure 5. Photo. The Reference Electrode (Wheel/rod) Placed on a Test Point.(2)The voltage values are stored in the data acquisition system or recorded by hand depending on the system being used.Once testing is complete, patch all tap locations with acceptable concrete materials (figure 6).Figure 6. Photo. Patching Test Holes.(2)The ionic solution in the reference electrode must be replaced periodically according to the manufacturer recommendations.Data ProcessingNo processing of HCP data is typically performed. Discrepancies in measurement accuracy may exist when there are extreme variations in the cover depth, and HCP measurements may need to be adjusted based on measuring deck electrical resistivity obtained at the same HCP test locations. However, in practice, data are generally gridded and mapped using contour-mapping software based on the measured HCP data.Data InterpretationGenerally,x– andy-coordinates are plotted against measured voltage to produce a map showing areas of very high likelihood for active corrosion, very low likelihood for active corrosion, or a transition zone that spans the measurements in between. According to ASTM C876–09,Standard Test Method for Half-Cell Potentials of Uncoated Reinforcing Steel in Concrete, a measured potential more negative than -350mV corresponds to a 90 percent probability of active corrosion.(4)A measured potential less negative than -200mV corresponds to a 90 percent probability of no active corrosion. Corrosion activity is uncertain if the potential is in the range of -350mV to -200mV (figure 7). HCP data are typically used with other physical or chemical sampling or other NDE methods. These methods can be used jointly to determine the corrosion state that exists within a bridge deck. Many researchers have shown a good correlation between GPR and HCP maps or other more direct measures of a corrosive environment or active corrosion. It is important to understand that these values are not absolute and depend on the material and environmental conditions of the measured reinforced concrete element.Figure 7. Contour Map. HCP Measurements Representing Spatial Distribution of thePotential Values.(2)AdvantagesRapid equipment setup, data collection, and data analysis.Easy to use with minimal training.Uncomplicated data processing; reduces to plotting the raw data.Economical.Moderately repeatable measurements.Correlates well with other NDE methods (GPR and electrical resistivity) and, to some extent, chemical sampling (chloride testing) to identify deck areas where corrosive environment and corrosion processes exist.LimitationsErroneous or impossible measurements due to isolating layers (asphalt, coating, and paint) on the deck surface or decks with coated rebars.Cannot be conducted if electrical continuity does not exist in the element being evaluated.Does not directly measure corrosion rate or the extent of past corrosion (rebar section loss due to corrosion).Unreliable measurements when the concrete is wet, dense, or polymer-modified.ReferencesGucunski, N., et.al.,Comprehensive Bridge Deck Deterioration Mapping of Nine Bridges by Nondestructive Evaluation Technologies, Project SPR-NDEB(90)-8H-00, Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation, Rutgers University, January, 2011.Strategic Highway Research Program, “SHRP2 NDToolbox,” (Website), Washington, DC, Accessed online: February, 2015.http://www.ndtoolbox.org/content/bridges.Gucunski, N., et. al.,Nondestructive Testing to Identify Concrete Bridge Deck Deterioration, Report S2-Ro6A-RR-1, SHRP2 Renewal Research, Transportation Research Board, 2013.ASTM,Standard, Standard Test Method for Half Cell Potentials of Reinforcing Steel in Concrete, C876, American Society for Testing and Materials, West Conshohocken."
Hammer Sounding,"Bridge - Hammer SoundingTarget of investigationsHammer sounding is beneficial in identifying defects at a shallow depth from the wood surface. The technique is generally sensitive to defects at the severe stage .DescriptionHammer sounding, commonly used for inspecting wood structures, involves tapping the wood surface with an object, such as a hammer, and listening to the echo. Damaged areas typically have a hollow or dull sound, and their echo is different from those in the surrounding regions. Hammer sounding is more appropriate for inspecting small regions. For example, as soon as visual inspection identifies suspected areas of damage, hammer sounding can be used to further investigate the region.Physical PrincipleHammer sounding is a vibration-based technique in which a hammer is used as an excitation source, and the inspector’s ears act as receivers. When an intact wood member is excited, its vibration frequency is related to its thickness and the velocity of sound in the member. For members with internal defects close to the surface, the vibration frequency is mainly affected by the vibration of the layer above the defects. Differences in the sound patterns caused by the vibration frequency of intact versus defective members enable an inspector to identify the defective regions.Data AcquisitionFor inspecting wood structures, a pick hammer, commonly used by geologists, is recommended.(1)The hammer allows for both sounding using the flat end and probing using the pick end. Hammer sounding is typically best used on side-grain, while pick probing can be used effectively at side- and end-grain locations. Once sounding detects potentially damaged or decayed areas, advanced inspection techniques, such as stress wave timing and resistance microdrilling, can be used for further investigations.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 1. Photos. A pick hammer is used for sounding and probing wood members.(1)Data ProcessingNo data processing is requiredData InterpretationAreas with hollow or dull sounds are marked on the wood structure as defective regions.AdvantagesHammer sounding includes the following advantages:Well-established field inspection technique.Quick and simple.Low cost.LimitationsSome limitations of hammer sounding include the following:May fail to detect early or intermediate stages of decay.(2)Can be subjective.Does not provide quantitative information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood members.ReferencesWhite, R.

High-Resolution Digital Photography,"Bridge - High-Resolution Digital PhotographyTarget of InvestigationHigh-resolution digital photography can be used as a vision-based nondestructive evaluation technique for bridge inspections, providing image data that support inspection reports, develops three-dimensional (3D) digital model reconstruction for bridge information modeling and documents, and detects and maps surface defects (e.g., cracks). Figure 1 shows an example of conducting vision-based bridge inspection for the Ticonic Bridge in Maine. The high-resolution digital photography can also be used for other engineering applications, including land surveying and emergency management of flooding.(1)This web page primarily focuses on using high‑resolution digital photography for surface crack detection.© 2020 VHB.®Figure 1. Photo. Image captured during bridge inspection showing visible cracks and concrete spalls.(2)DescriptionHigh-resolution digital photography refers to the capture of digital images with a large number of pixels, resulting in a high level of visual details. This capture is typically achieved by using high‑definition (HD) digital cameras with advanced image sensors and lenses technology. Now high-resolution digital photography for vision-based bridge inspections mainly uses unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipped with HD digital cameras. Because UAS has the capability of collecting HD image data in challenging environments with limited traffic control, HD imaging through UAS can improve efficiency, enhance safety, and lower the economic costs of bridge inspections compared to manual visual inspections by inspectors. The collected HD image data can support inspection reports, develop 3D-digital model reconstruction, and diagnose surface defects (e.g., cracks).The creation of a 3D-digital model provides bridge owners with many advantages, including creating a structural visualization in the absence of original drawings, supplementing essential information for numerical modeling, which can be used alone or in combination with other inspection data, and providing a data archive for postinspection review. Surface defect mapping provides useful information about the location and severity of surface defects across structural surfaces. The mapping results can be used as evidence for executing additional indepth analysis or inspection. For more information about the use of UAS to support bridge inspections, refer to a Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) report and TechBriefs. (See references 2–5.)Physical PrincipleDigital cameras capture images through an optical system that uses a lens with a variable diagram to focus light onto an electronic image-pickup device. Because surface defects (e.g., cracks) present different visual appearances than surrounding areas, surface defects are likely identifiable through visual examination or image analysis.Data AcquisitionData acquisition involves collecting image data from digital cameras. Various features of the camera and its operations may influence the quality of the images. Based on laboratory results from an FHWA-sponsored research project, the following sensor specification and operational practices for using UAS digital cameras are recommended:(4)Sensor resolution should be at least 12 megapixels.Automatic sensor setting is sufficient.Maintain a minimum standoff distance of 5 ft.Optical zoom capability is a plus but not necessary.Augmented lighting can improve image quality in low-light conditions.Data ProcessingCrack detection can be manually implemented through visual examination, which is labor intensive and inefficient. Automatic crack detection is achievable through image processing techniques. Sobel and Canny edge detectors are examples of two edge detection algorithms available.(5,6)With recent advancements in machine learning and the availability of large-scale training image databases, using deep-learning algorithms for crack detection is more efficient and accurate, and thus, deep learning has become popular and dominant in recent years. The convolutional neural network is the primary deep-learning model that yields high accuracy for crack detection.(7)For more information about using deep learning for crack detection, see an early work by a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Canada, and a recent report from an FHWA-sponsored research project.(8)Data InterpretationCrack detection results are usually visually intuitive. All visible cracks should be properly noted in bridge inspections.(9,10)AdvantagesIdentify surface defects through visual examination.Achieve limited traffic control with UAS.Hold potential for automatic crack detection with advanced image processing algorithms.Enable data storage for further use (e.g., 3D-digital model reconstruction and postinspection review).LimitationsManual visual examination can be subject to performance fatigue of inspectors.Special specifications are required for the camera and its operation.Moderate to significant expertise and training are required for developing automatic crack detection.ReferencesFHWA. n.d. “Unmanned Ariel Systems” (web page).https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/uas/library.cfm, last accessed February 22, 2024.Neubauer, K., E.

Impact Echo (IE),"Bridge - Impact Echo (IE)Target of InvestigationPrimary applications of IE include the following:Detecting and characterizing delamination on reinforced concrete elements.Characterization of grouting in tendon ducts.Debonding detection on decks with overlays.Measuring the thickness of slabs and walls.IE has also been used with limited success in the following applications:Evaluating the depth and primary direction of surface opening cracks (vertical cracks in bridge decks).Detecting ducts and voids in ducts, as long as the diameter to concrete cover ratio is above a certain threshold, roughly one third. While horizontal position can be well-defined, it is difficult to accurately define the concrete cover thickness. Detection of ducts requires a scanning approach and in most case requires a higher level expertise.DescriptionThe IE method is a seismic or stress-wave based method used to detect defects in concrete, primarily delamination. The objective of the IE survey is to detect and characterize wave reflectors or “resonators” in a concrete bridge deck or other structural elements. IE devices can have multiple IE probes (figure 1) or a single IE probe (figure 2), each consisting of an impactor and a sensor.Figure 1. Photo. Automated IE Equipment.(1)Figure 2. Photo. Manual IE Testing Using a Single IE Probe and a Close Up of the Probe.Physical PrincipleThe impact echo (IE) test is conducted using an impact source and a nearby receiver. The impact generates waves that propagate within the solid material. Waves are reflected by internal defects (difference in acoustic impedance) or external boundaries. When the reflected waves, or echoes, return to the surface, they produce displacements. The transient response time of the solid structure is measured with a sensor mounted on the surface close to the impact source. The multiple reflected waves monitored by the sensor manifest as resonance conditions in the frequency domain analyses.Data AcquisitionFor a complete data collection procedure, refer to ASTMC1383, Test Method for Measurement P-Wave Speed and the Thickness of Concrete Plates Using the Impact-Echo Method.(2)The deck surface to be surveyed needs to be cleaned of debris before IE testing. The survey should be conducted on the densest grid possible (a 2-ft by 2-ft grid is recommended). Mark the grid using a washable paint or chalk. Data collection can conducted using a variety of devices, each providing a different level of accuracy, speed, and automation.The equipment used for IE testing consists of an impactor (figure 3) and a sensor recording the response of the deck or other structure.(2)The impactor should be selected carefully to provide enough energy in the frequency range of interest. Some impactors are equipped with a sensor to measure the characteristics of the impact. The following are the wavelength frequency requirements:It should be shorter that the lateral size of the defect.It should be shorter than twice the depth of the defect to be detected.A simple rule used in the definition of the maximum useful frequency is the inverse of the impact duration (contact time), which is typically from 20 to 100 µs. Many IE systems utilize steel balls of different sizes as impact sources, where the center and maximum frequencies are inversely proportional to the ball diameter.Figure 3. Photo. Close Up of Manual IE Testing on a Bridge Deck.(1)Data ProcessingThe amplitude spectrum obtained from the fast Fourier transform analysis of the time signal will show dominant peaks at certain frequencies, which can be interpreted to assess the deck condition. Energy partitioning of elastic waves may vary depending on the extent and continuity of the delamination. Different subjective grades can be assigned to a particular section of a deck as a part of the condition assessment process.The thickness mode normally dominates the spectral response of a plate-like structure that does not contain any near-surface defects.(3)The frequency of the fundamental thickness mode can be related to the thickness of the deck (figure 4).Figure 4. Equation. Deck Thickness.(3)Where:β = Correction factor.Cp= Compression-wave velocity of concrete.fIE= IE frequency.The spectra shown in figure 5 are examples of IE results for different severity levels of delamination. They correspond to the tested areas above them. In the case of a sound deck (good condition), a distinctive peak in the response spectrum corresponding to the full depth of the deck can be observed. An initial or incipient delamination (fair condition) is identified through the presence of two distinct peaks, indicating energy partitioning from two dominant wave propagation patterns, the first peak corresponding to reflections from the bottom of the deck and the second one to reflections from the delamination. Progressed delamination (poor condition) is characterized by a single peak at a frequency corresponding to a reflector depth that is shallower than the deck thickness, indicating that little or no energy is being propagated towards the bottom of the deck. Finally, in the very severe case of a wide or shallow delamination (serious condition), the dominant response of the deck to an impact is characterized by the low-frequency response of flexural mode oscillations of the upper delaminated portion of the element. This response is almost always in the audible frequency range.Figure 5. Illustration. Physical Principle of IE.(4)Data InterpretationIE results are presented in various forms, some describing the position of reflectors, some interpreting the condition with respect to the state of delamination.(1)Some of the approaches are presented below.Figure 6 presents the dominant reflectors, or resonators, in terms of the spectral surface. The colors refer to different dominant frequencies identified in the response spectrum. Blue colors, between 8 and 10 kHz, refer to the bottom of the deck, meaning no defect. Red colors correspond to flexural oscillations of shallow delaminations.Figure 6. Contour Map. IE Data Presented as Frequency Spectral Surface.(5)The results are often described in terms of different condition grades related to the state of progression of delamination development (figure 7). For example, the fair and poor grades refer to incipient or progressed delamination, and the serious grade corresponds to either shallow or wide delamination.Figure 7. Contour Map. Condition Assessment with Respect to Delamination Progression.(1)AdvantagesCan detect delamination at very early stages.Can detect debonding of layers, like concrete type overlays.Fast data analysis with respect to delamination characterization.Unambiguous data interpretation.Testing insensitive to traffic induced vibrations.Reliable and repeatable when conducted properly by an experienced operator.LimitationsModerate to significant expertise and training required for equipment setup and data collection, processing, and interpretation.Slow data collection using traditional single probe equipment; requires lane closure.Requires a dense test grid to accurately define the boundaries of delaminated areas, adding to the test duration.More complicated to evaluate the condition of overlaid bridge decks; cannot assess the condition of the deck in areas where the overlay is debonded.Geometrical and boundary effects should be taken into consideration, especially for structural elements, like girders, piers, and pier caps.ReferencesStrategic Highway Research Program, “SHRP2 NDToolbox,” (Website), Washington, DC, Accessed online: February 2015,http://www.ndtoolbox.org/content/bridges.ASTM,Standard Test Method for Measuring the P-Wave Speed and the Thickness of Concrete Plates Using the Impact-Echo Method, C1383-04(2010), ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2010.Sansalone, M., and Carino, N., “Detecting Delaminations in Concrete Slabs with and without Overlays Using the Impact-Echo Method,” ACI Materials Journal, Vol. 86, No. 2, pp. 175–184, 1989.Gucunski, N., et. al.,Nondestructive Testing to Identify Concrete Bridge Deck Deterioration, Report S2-Ro6A-RR-1, SHRP2 Renewal Research, Transportation Research Board, 2013.Azari, H., Yuan, D., Nazarian, S., and Gucunski, N., “Sonic Methods to Detect Delamination in Concrete Bridge Decks: Impact of Testing Configuration and Data Analysis Approach,” Transportation Research Record (TRR): Journal of Transportation Research Board, No. 2292, Transportation Research Board of the National Academics, Washington, DC, pp. 113-124, 2012."
Infrared Thermography (IT),"Tunnel - Infrared Thermography (IT)Target of InvestigationInfrared thermography uses thermal cameras to record a surface’s electromagnetic wave radiations, which are related to temperature variations in an infrared wavelength.(1)For evaluating tunnels, infrared thermography is best used as a scanning tool to indicate where indepth testing should be performed with other systems.(2–4)Infrared thermography can be used for the following applications:Identifying delamination and shallow voids within concrete.Detecting debonding of architectural finishing elements.Locating moisture intrusion.DescriptionInfrared thermography detects potential defects and material variations within a structure. Infrared cameras measure the radiation emitted by a structure and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then processed to create maps of surface temperatures.(1)Defects, such as delamination, voids, debonding, and moisture intrusion, have different material properties (density, thermal conductivity, and specific-heat capacity) than sound concrete. The heating and cooling behavior of a surface can be used to indicate locations of potential defects. Research and testing have shown that infrared thermography systems are adequate for scanning purposes in tunnels.(2)While these systems cannot measure depth, they may detect moisture-containing voids up to 3 inches (76.2 mm) deep. Infrared thermography can be used for concrete, tile-lined concrete, and shotcrete tunnel linings. Active and passive heating are used in infrared thermography. Active heating uses a heat source, such as halogen lamps or electrical heating, to artificially heat the structure. Passive heating uses environmental conditions to heat the structure. Because active heating is impractical for large survey areas in tunnel applications, passive heating is used.(3)A typical handheld thermal camera suitable for tunnel surveys is shown in figure 1.Source: FHWA.Figure 1. Photo. Handheld infrared camera.Physical PrincipleInfrared radiation is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths between 0.7 and 14 µm (0.028 and 0.55 mils). Infrared cameras measure the thermal radiation emitted by a body and capture temperature differences. These temperature variations are the result of heat flow and distribution within the body. These factors are affected by the thermal conductivity, specific-heat capacity, and density of the material.(1)Defects can cause heat flow and distribution to vary within the body and resulting surface temperatures to vary from those of a sound material.(2,4,5)For sound materials, heat is conducted away from the surface by the mass of the substrate during the heating process; thus, the temperature will increase slowly. For areas with air-filled defects (delamination, debonded tiles, or voids), the air pocket acts as a small insulator, trapping heat in the surface materials and causing the surface to heat faster. For debonded tiles that have moisture within the cavity, the water increases the specific-heat capacity, resulting in slower heating than the surrounding material.(4)When a structure is cooling, a cavity containing air cools faster than the surrounding sound concrete, and a cavity containing moisture cools slower than the surrounding sound concrete. Because underground water usually has a lower temperature than the ambient air and the structural members in a tunnel, water leakage and moisture intrusion usually register at lower temperatures in thermal images.Data AcquisitionIn tunnels, infrared thermography should be employed as a scanning tool to indicate where indepth testing using other methods should be performed. Scans should be collected every 1 ft (0.3 m) or at an interval determined by the inspector. Thermal images should be collected while the temperature is rising or falling because temperature changes provide a better chance of detecting possible defects. Surveys with handheld infrared cameras can be conducted at walking speed.(2)Since thermal anomalies appear differently depending on environmental conditions, such as the season, planning when and how to conduct surveys is important. Early summer is the best time to conduct thermal surveys. Winter is the worst season; tunnel walls might be frozen, which results in blurry images and increases the likelihood of not detecting all anomalies. Survey direction also affects thermal images, so survey direction should be uniform during evaluations.(2)The operator must ensure that the camera is properly focused before data collection begins. A typical process for collecting a thermal image is as follows:(2)Aim the camera at the tunnel lining. Note the temperature of the lining in the center of the display.Manually set a temperature range of approximately 5 ℉ (2.8 °C) (for example, 60–65 ℉ [15.5–18.3 °C] if the tunnel lining temperature at the center of the display is 62 ℉ [16.7 °C]).Adjust the range so that a color spectrum appears on the camera display.Record the image.Data ProcessingThermal cameras contain data collection and management software. Images are stored with an image number and date and are later transferred to a computer. Thermal camera manufacturers provide software to further refine and inspect the images. The software has many functions, such as filtering the temperature data by a defined temperature range, changing the color palette, and so on. It can also output the thermal pictures in digital form so that analysis of the raw data can be performed with other software.Data InterpretationInfrared thermography surveys generally yield thermal images produced by a camera (figure 2 through figure 4). Such cameras can also be used to create thermal maps of the surface (figure 5). Images of the test site are used to detect moisture intrusion based on relative temperature differences within an image. Sections with excess moisture can be identified as cold spots in thermal images because of the low temperature of underground water. Interpretation of moisture measurements can be difficult because of factors like material emissivity changes, heat transfer through wet sections, cooling through air flow, and spurious radiation sources.(5)Interpretation of thermal images requires understanding of both thermographic principles and structural engineering practices.(3)© 2014 TRB.T°F = 1.8 × (T°C + 32).Figure 2.

In figure 3, debonded tiles (confirmed by a sounding evaluation) are indicated by the arrows on the tunnel wall. Figure 4 shows an air-filled void in a test specimen.(2)Environmental conditions should be considered when interpreting thermal images. These conditions include surface texture, which influences the surface temperature, and thermal reflections from vehicles within the tunnel (figure 6).(2)© 2014 TRB.T°F= 1.8 × (T°C+ 32).Figure 6.

Linear Polarization (LPR),"Bridge - Linear Polarization (LPR)Target of InvestigationLPR can be used in tandem with other corrosion assessment techniques such as HCP, which identifies corrosion activity, or ER, which describes corrosive environment, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of corrosion. The corrosion rates can be used to predict the remaining service life of a tested structure. However, as the test results only indicate the instantaneous rates of steel bar corrosion, using the obtained corrosion rates for such purpose is limited and still of controversy.DescriptionWhen the passive oxide film that protects the steel is broken by an unfavorable environment in the concrete, the potential difference produces a current within a micro electrolytic cell. At the anode of this cell, iron atoms transform to ferrous ions, move into the surrounding concrete, and leave their free electrons on the steel bar. When the corrosion continues, these free electrons accumulate and give the rebar negative charge. The HCP method, based on detecting these negative charges, finds regions with likely corrosion activities, and the LPR technique helps identify the rate of rebar corrosion. Figure 1 shows the LPR method.Figure 1. Photo. LPR Testing Setup.Physical PrincipleThe LPR technique is a method for evaluating instantaneous rate of rebar corrosion.(1)The technique is noninvasive but requires a localized damage to the concrete cover to enable an electrical connection to be made to the reinforcing steel. The principal of LPR is based on disturbing the corrosion equilibrium on the surface of steel reinforcing bars by introducing a small perturbative electrical signal using a surface counter electrode (figure 2). Monitoring the relationship between electrochemical potential and current generated between electrically charged electrodes under the test allows the calculation of the corrosion rate. The data provides the instantaneous rate of the steel reinforcement corrosion at the test location, giving more detailed information than a simple HCP measurement.The term “polarization” refers to the change in the open-circuit potential as a result of the passage of current produced by the auxiliary electrode. For a small perturbation of the open circuit potential, there is a linear relationship between the change in voltage and the change in applied current per unit area of electrodes, and this ratio is called the polarization resistance.The LPR technique may be used for accurate measurement of corrosion rates. It is very sensitive, so very low rates can be identified. Used with HCP, the technique provides complete knowledge about the state of corrosion activity.Figure 2. Illustration. Linear Polarization Resistance MeasurementData AcquisitionThe first step in the LPR data collection is to expose the steel reinforcement and makepositive electrical contact (tap). After confirming the continuity of the electrical conductivity between the contact point and reinforcement in the concrete area being tested, the LRP test can be performed using either manual or automated methods.For the manual method, readings are collected using a three-electrode polarization resistance (3LP) system, and the reinforcement is polarized through manual operations. First, the electrical potential is monitored until it is stable, with potential variations of no more than +/- 5 mV per minute. If readings are not stable, it may indicate inadequate moisture or interference by an external electrical source, which should be evaluated and rectified before proceeding. Once a stable potential is established, the electrical potential value  is recorded. The system is set to report a relative potential, versus the open-circuit potential, and the meter is zeroed. Electrical current is then applied to polarize the reinforcement at a slow, steady rate, such that the offset potential reaches +4, +8, and +12 mV from the open-circuit potential. At each noted potential increment, the corresponding current required to achieve that offset is recorded. The complete polarization procedure should take no longer than 2 minutes. Once complete, the current is removed, and the reinforcement is allowed to de-polarize. Within 3 minutes, the potential should return to the open-circuit potential. If it does not, then the associated “drift” in open-circuit potential will influence the measured corrosion rate, so the measurement should be re-taken. A period of 5 to 10 minutes should pass before repeating readings to ensure adequate de-polarization.Some field instruments and laboratory potentiostats can be programmed (or are pre-programmed) to perform the polarization process automatically. Such systems should be programmed to linearly perturb the potential to at least +12 mV and no more than +20 mV from open-circuit potential at a rate of 10 mV per minute. It is preferred that the system monitors and collects the open-circuit potential, recording potentials in 1 second intervals for at least 1 minute before and after the test. Some devices are equipped with a “guard ring” electrode that induces a separate current into the electrode that surrounds and attempts to “contain” the primary counter electrode current into a specified polarization area. Such instruments are known to give significantly different corrosion rate values than the methods outlined above and are believed to underestimate the actual corrosion rate.Data ProcessingData processing of LPR test involves three main steps:Step 1: Calculate the area (A) of the rebar affected (perturbed) by the measurement.Step 2: Calculate polarization resistance (Rp) by dividing the measured potential (resulted from current change) by small current step (used as the perturbative signal).Step 3: Calculate the corrosion rate(icorr) as shown in figure 3.Figure 3. Equation. Rate of Corrosion.Where:B = a potential constant.(2)Rp= polarization resistance.A = area of steel being perturbed.Typical values of corrosion rates from LPR measurements are presented in table 1.Table 1.

Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL),"Bridge - Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL)Target of InvestigationThe MFL method can be used to detect the location and extent of corrosion in post-tensioned and precast prestressed strands in concrete girders, and breakage of wires and strands in post-tensioning tendons and prestressing strands. MFL is also commonly used to test the cables of suspension or cable stayed bridges. MFL units can be clamped onto a cable as part of a climbing module or rolled across a surface.DescriptionThe MFL method uses a magnetic field to detect flaws in ferromagnetic materials such as steel in bridge components like prestressed girders, post-tensioned girders and decks, and suspension cables. The technique involves using an electromagnet or a permanent magnet yoke to magnetize the object being tested. The injected magnetic fluxes flow through the ferromagnetic object because it has a higher permeability than air. Any defect or discontinuity in the test object causes leakage of magnetic fluxes from the object, detectable by magnetic field sensors. It is very similar to magnetic particle testing, however instead of using magnetic particles to create a visual indication on the surface, MFL uses sensors and data processing to provide real-time results during inspections.Physical PrincipleMFL equipment magnetizes embedded reinforcement bar (like steel, prestressed element/strand, post-tensioned tendon, etc.) inside a concrete structure along its length via an external magnet. The potential leakage of the magnetic field from the magnetized reinforcement is evaluated by one or more magnetic sensors within the MFL equipment.(1)The output of the sensors is normally recorded in the form of the magnetic signal amplitude as a function of the position along the length of the reinforcement being tested (figure 1). Without flaws present, the internal magnetic flux lines are uniform and travel through the material. Any change in the magnetic field within reinforcement can be linked to the extent of section loss from corrosion or fracture in the reinforcement.Figure 1. Illustration. Magnetic Flux Leakage.Data AcquisitionOnly a limited number of private service entities possess the required equipment to perform MFL tests on concrete girders or decks. One or more magnetic sensors are used in the MFL equipment. MFL equipment may be operated manually by moving the equipment on the top of a bridge deck or close to the concrete surface and along the length of the prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendon located inside the concrete. It is also possible to use a robotic mechanism to perform the MFL testing with little to no interruption of traffic flowing under bridge girders (figure 1). For MFL testing on the underside of prestressed adjacent box girders, platforms are necessary for operating the equipment.(1)Figure 2. Photo. Use of the MFL Equipment on Prestressed Concrete I-Girders.Data ProcessingPostprocessing of the MFL data is required when detecting small section losses, e.g., less than approximately 10 percent or when there are interfering materials and elements near the prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendons inside concrete. Such postprocessing approaches include comparative and correlation analyses based on existing results from known laboratory and field conditions.Data InterpretationThe operator monitors the magnetic field amplitude as a function of the test position on a computer screen in real time to identify changes in the magnetic field. In the absence of interfering ferromagnetic materials in the surrounding areas of prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendons, a real-time visual examination of the MFL data or graphs can offer sufficient knowledge about the lack or presence of corrosion or fracture in the strands. Any changes in the magnetic field can be directly related to section loss in the prestressing strands or in the post-tensioning tendons due to corrosion or fracture.(2)When there are interfering ferromagnetic materials near the prestressing strands or post-tensioning tendons, more advanced analysis and interpretation of the MFL signal are necessary. Figure 2 shows a MFL graph for a prestressing strand in an in-service bridge that includes a strand fracture as well as transverse steel bars (stirrups).Figure 3. Composite Graph. MFL Record and Calculated Change.AdvantagesAbility to make a qualitative estimate of section loss.Rapid testing of a large number of surface areas.Automated testing of concrete girders allows for testing with little to no interruption to traffic.LimitationsDifficult data interpretation when interfering ferromagnetic materials are present.Only reliable for post-tensioning tendons and prestressing strands within approximately 6 inches of the concrete surface.Inexact measurements of flaw sizes (section losses).Uses specialized equipment not readily available commercially.Requires well-trained and experienced operators.ReferencesGhorbanpoor, A., Borchelt, R., Edwards, M., and Abdel Salam, E.,Magnetic-Based NDE of Prestressed and Post-Tensioned Concrete Members – The MFL System, FHWA-RD-00-026, Federal Highway Administration, US DOT, May 2000.McGogney, C., “Magnetic Flux Leakage for Bridge Inspection,” Nondestructive Testing Methods for Civil Infrastructure, pp. 31-44, 1995."
Magnetic Particle Testing (MT),"Bridge - Magnetic Particle Testing (MT)Target of InvestigationMT is commonly applied for crack detection in steel girders, steel truss members, and ancillary steel structures such as sign supports and light poles. The method may be applied during the fabrication process to ensure the quality of welds or may be applied to in-service structures for the detection of cracks developed from service loads.DescriptionMT is a method of locating surface and subsurface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials. When the material or part being tested is magnetized, magnetic discontinuities that lie in a direction transverse to the direction of the magnetic field, a leakage field is formed at and above the surface of the part. The presence of this leakage field, and therefore the presence of the discontinuity, is detected by using finely divided ferromagnetic particles applied over the surface, with some of the particles being gathered and held by the leakage field. This magnetically held collection of particles forms an outline of the discontinuity and indicates its location, size, shape, and extent. Magnetic particles are applied over a surface as dry particles or as wet particles in a liquid carrier such as water or oil.Physical PrincipleMT works on the physical principles of magnetic induction and magnetic field leakage. This method can only be applied to ferromagnetic materials, such as steel. When a specimen is subjected to a magnetic field, the presence of a defect will cause local distortions in the magnetic field around the defect area. This effect is referred to as magnetic flux leakage. If fine particles of magnetic material are placed on the specimen in the presence of the magnet field, they will become oriented in alignment with the magnetic flux lines and the disruption of those lines caused by a defect.Figure 1. Illustration. Magnetic Particle Basic Principle.Data AcquisitionMT is typically applied using a “dry powder” method for crack detection in steel bridge components. Magnetic particles infused with a colored dye are broadcast onto the surface of the material under test. A blower may be used to remove excess powder from the surface; particles not confined by a magnetic field are removed, particles confined by magnetic forces remain forming the indication.Surface preparation for applying MT includes removing coatings to ensure effective coupling of the magnetic field into the material under test. Removing the coating also reduces the likelihood of nonrelevant indications forming from debris on the surface or imperfections in the coating itself. Debris or imperfections in the coating can mechanically confine the particles resulting in a nonrelevant indication. Care must be taken to ensure crack openings are not obscured during coating removal using mechanical removal processes (e.g., grinding).The orientation of the magnetic fields induced in the material must be orthogonal to a crack opening to ensure sufficient leakage field to capture magnetic particles. Direct magnetization using prods develops circular magnetic fields around each prod. Consequently, the orientation of a crack must lie parallel to an imaginary line connecting the prods. In contrast, indirect magnetization results in a magnetic field in the material that is parallel to an imaginary line connecting the yokes. Therefore, the crack must be oriented orthogonal to an imaginary line connecting the yokes. When the orientation of cracks is not known, procedures for MT typically require reorientation of the yokes or prods in orthogonal positions to ensure cracks are detected reliably.(1)Data ProcessingCrack indications are detected by visual inspection; therefore, no processing of data is required.Data InterpretationThe primary data acquired from MT are indications on the surface of the material created from accumulated magnetic particles. These indications are interpreted by an inspector to determine if the source of the indication is a crack or if the indication is caused by a non-crack geometric feature, contamination on the surface of the material, or some other nonrelevant source. Relevant indications (i.e., crack indications) are documented by the inspector through notes, photographs, and/or diagrams.Figure 2 shows typical MT crack indications in a weld that connects a vertical stiffener to a girder web.Figure 2. Photo. Crack Exposed using MT.AdvantagesLow cost.Widely available on a commercial basis.Minimal data processing.Simple interpretation of results.LimitationsDetects only surface-breaking or very near surface flaws.Surface preparation required.ReferencesASTM,Standard Guide for Magnetic Particle Testing, E709-08, ASTM International, Conshohcken, PA, 2008."
Magnetometer (MM),"Bridge - Magnetometer (MM)Target of InvestigationMagnetometer is an instrument mainly used to detect rebar size, rebar orientation, rebar location, rebar depth (concrete cover depth). Magnetometer is also commonly used to obtain as-built information on embedded rebar when there are no record drawings available. Though magnetometers cannot detect corrosion directly, their ability to measure cover is helpful; lower cover increases the ability for concrete to deteriorate and expose steel to oxygen and moisture.DescriptionThe first magnetometers, known as “covermeters,” “profometer,” or “pachometers,” were manufactured in the 1950s. Prior to the mid-1980s, magnetometers were built based on the magnetic reluctance principle.(1)More recent devices have been manufactured according to the concept of electrical conductivity to offer better system stability for detecting ferrous and nonferrous metals inside concrete.Magnetometer is commonly used in conjunction with other NDE technologies. For example, for tests requiring a concrete core sample or contact with embedded steel reinforcement through drilling a hole, a magnetometer can help the drill miss any reinforcement. Additionally, a magnetometer can quickly and easily handle construction inspection quality control for recently-constructed bridges if, for example, there is a question about adequate cover (e.g., determining if a rebar cage floated up during the concrete pour).Physical PrincipleMagnetometers are based on an electromagnetic field and are unaffected by nonconductive materials such as concrete, composite, and timber. The eddy current principal charges a primary coil, creating a magnetic field. Eddy currents are produced on the surface of any electrically conductive material in the vicinity of the magnetic field. The eddy currents induce a magnetic field in the opposite direction of the primary coil field. This opposition affects the measured impedance in the coil. Reinforcing bars that are closer to the probe or are larger produce a stronger magnetic field. They operate at frequencies above 1 kHz. The magnetic induction principle is similar to that of a transformer. Primary coils are charged while a secondary set of coils pick up the voltage transferred by the magnetic circuit created by the primary coils and rebar. Magnetometers based on magnetic induction are less sensitive than ones using eddy current principles. Regardless of the principle used, the size, orientation, and location of the rebar (concrete cover) affect voltage measurement, in terms of amplitude and phase difference.(1,2)Magnetometers using induction operate at frequencies below 90 Hz.When an electrically conductive material, e.g., steel rebar inside concrete, is subjected to a changing magnetic field, eddy currents are generated along the material’s surface. The eddy currents induce a magnetic field in an opposite direction of the initially introduced magnetic field that causes a voltage change in one or more coils or sensors inside the probe. The voltage change is a function of the rebar size, location, and orientation. The voltage change, in terms of amplitude and phase difference, is measured and analyzed to estimate rebar size, location (concrete cover), and orientation.Data AcquisitionA magnetometer consists of a magnetic probe and a data processor with a display screen. In some equipment, the probe, data processor, and display screen are integrated into a single lightweight, hand-held device. The probe is moved along the surface of a concrete deck or girder. As the operator moves the probe, he/she can observe magnetic field changes on the screen in either a digital or graphical form. Rebar orientation can be determined through a planar rotation of the probe at the concrete surface. The longitudinal axis of the probe is aligned with the direction of the rebar when a maximum value of the magnetic field is indicated on the screen of the magnetometer.Mapping rebar in concrete decks may be accomplished by scanning the concrete surface with the probe in different directions (figure 1). The operator marks the concrete surface when the location and orientation of each rebar are determined.(3)Some commercially available equipment has the capability to map rebar in concrete decks and display a rebar grid on the screen. The data may be recorded and saved for post-processing and documentation.Figure 1. Photo. Locating a Rebar with a Magnetometer (Profometer).Data ProcessingAll data processing is performed internally by the data processor component of the equipment. As such, no significant data manipulation is required by the operator. The data processor is programmed to compare detected magnetic field changes with those from known rebar sizes at different depths inside concrete to make an estimate of the rebar size and location.Data InterpretationMagnetometers are simple to operate, with minimal operator training required. However, experience is required to interpret the results in complex cases (e.g., dense rebar placement). To minimize the effect of the nearby ferromagnetic materials, the maximum depth of concrete cover should be limited to about two-thirds of the distance between two adjacent bars. When both the rebar size and concrete cover are unknown, the operator must assume a value for one (usually the rebar size) to estimate the other unknown parameter.AdvantagesProvides rapid information about rebar size, orientation, or concrete cover.Field-worthy equipment.Easy to operate equipment, with minimal operator training required.Audible output with available headset option for working in noisy environments.Some systems applicable to non-ferrous metals, e.g., stainless steel bars.Relatively inexpensive and commercially available equipment.LimitationsOnly effective within top 4 inches of the concrete surface.Only first layer of reinforcing steel may be located and sized.Decreased effective depth as rebar spacing decreases. For a concrete cover estimate to be accurate, the parallel rebar spacing must be 1.5 times greater than the concrete cover.Ineffective in regions of congested reinforcing steel.Difficult data interpretation when there is interference due to the presence of other magnetic materials such as adjacent parallel rebar, external magnetic field, and magnetic aggregates in concrete.For prestressed concrete bridge girder applications, only effective only within a depth equal to two-thirds of the parallel strand spacing.Time intensive for rebar mapping.ReferencesBray, D.E., and Stanley, R.K.,Nondestructive Evaluation—A Tool in Design, Manufacturing and Service, McGraw Hill, New York, 1989.ASTM, “Standard Guide for Use of the Metal Detection Method for Subsurface Exploration,” D7046-11, ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2011.Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), “Use of Magnetic Tomography Technology to Evaluate Dowel Placement,” (Website), Washington, DC, Accessed online: February 2015,http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/concrete/mitreport/mits02.cfm."
Moisture Content Measurement,"Bridge - Moisture Content MeasurementTarget of investigationsEstimating the moisture content of wood is important as the potential for wood decay increases for moisture contents greater than 20 percent, and serious decay can occur at moisture contents above 30 percent. High moisture levels can occur when wood is exposed to rain, groundwater, or moisture infiltration.(1)Fully saturated members do not develop fungi decay due to the lack of oxygen; however, since the water level of rivers or streams tend to change with time, timber piles are prone to fungal decay, especially at the water’s surface (i.e., the mud zone).(1)DescriptionRather than directly measuring the wood moisture level, electrical moisture meters estimate the moisture level of wood by measuring the change in its electrical properties such as conductivity (inverse of resistivity), dielectric constant, or power loss factor due to absorbing moisture.(2)Physical PrincipleThe electrical properties of wood can change by approximately 10 orders of magnitude as its possible moisture content changes. Such a high sensitivity to the presence of moisture has led to the common application of electrical-based techniques for the accurate prediction of the wood moisture content.(2)The electrical-based techniques commonly estimate the conductivity of wood members using direct current (DC) and typically measure the dielectric properties of wood with an alternating current (AC).ConductivityThe relationship between the applied DC voltage (V) and measured current (I) at the two ends of a conducting member with length L, and cross-section area A is as follows:Figure 1. Equation. The conductivity equation.Where ρ is resistivity, and it has a unit of Ω.m. Furthermore, conductivity (σ) is equal to 1/ρ.(2)The conductivity of wood is substantially affected by its moisture content. The conductivity of oven-dried wood is in the order of 10-16-10-15S m,-1,while at fiber saturation, it is in the order of 10-4-10-3S m-1. From fiber saturation level to a fully saturated wood, conductivity typically increases less than one hundred times.(2)For example, the conductivity of slash pine in the longitudinal direction for moisture content between 8 percent and 180 percent is shown in figure 2.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 2. Scatter plot. Conductivity versus moisture content of slash pine.(2)Wood conductivity is also influenced by the fiber direction and temperature.(2)Conductivity tends to increase with temperature. Furthermore, conductivity is higher along fibers (grains) than across them, with slightly higher in the radial direction than tangential direction (figure 3). The ratio of electrical conductivity in the longitudinal, radial, and tangential directions is approximately 1.0:0.55:0.5.(2)Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 3. Schematic. Principal axes of wood with respect to fiber direction and annual growth rings.(1)Dielectric propertiesWhen the alternating current is used, the dielectric constant of material can be expressed as follows:Figure 4. Equation. The dielectric equation.Where,  is the real part of the dielectric constant andε” is the imaginary part. In the wood literature, it is common to refer toε‘  as the dielectric constant.(2)Bothε‘   andε”are frequency- and temperature-dependent. At 1 MHz, theε’of dry wood is approximately 3, and that of wet wood is approximately 100. At each frequency,ε”  increases with moisture content and temperature.ε’is larger parallel to the grain than across the grain.(2)Another parameter is the power factor (fp), which can be expressed as follows:Figure 5. Equation. The principle equation of the dielectric moisture meter.fpis a measure of the heat produced as a dielectric material is exposed to an electric field, and it is used in dielectric moisture meters to estimate the moisture content of wood. The power factor of wood varies from 0.01 for dry and low-density wood to 0.95 for wet and dense wood. The power factor is usually larger along the grain than across the grain. Similar to ,fpis affected by frequency, moisture, and temperature.(2)Data AcquisitionThere are two main types of electrical moisture meters: conductance type and dielectric-based moisture meters. The conductance type electrodes measure the conductivity of direct current between the device’s two electrodes. On the other hand, the dielectric-based moisture meters can measure either the dielectric constant or power loss factor. The ones that estimate the dielectric constant are referred to as capacitance or capacitive admittance meters, while the electrical moisture meters that measure the power loss factor are called power loss meters.(2)The electrodes of conductance-type moisture meters (up to 3 inches long) can be driven into the timber to assess the electrical resistance between two pins (figure 6). These electrodes are either uninsulated or insulated, except for the tip of the electrodes. The uninsulated electrodes estimate the lowest resistance along their lengths, while insulated electrodes give the resistance at their tips. The 3 inch-long insulated electrodes (pin-style electrodes) are highly recommended for bridge applications and allow for determining moisture gradients along the penetration depth. Results from the conductance-type moisture meters need to be corrected for the temperature and type of species. Approximate correction for wood temperature involves adding 0.5 percent for each 10 ℉ temperature lower than the device’s calibration temperature and subtracting 0.5 percent for each 10 ℉ temperature higher than the device’s calibration temperature. Newer moisture meters include settings for automatic corrections based on the species and entered temperature.Furthermore, the type of preservatives can affect results. Since the resistance of a medium is affected by the presence of salts, the use of conductance-type moisture meters in estimating the moisture content of timber pressure treated with salt-based preservatives (i.e., alkaline copper quaternary and chromated copper arsenate can be unreliable.(3)In this case, drill cores can be used to determine moisture content via oven-dry methods (ASTM 4442(4)or ASTM D4444(5)).Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 6. Photo. Conductance type (pin-style) moisture meter.(1)The newer capacitance electrodes are mainly sensitive to the near-surface moisture of timber members, and they require specific gravity to estimate the moisture content.(2)The specific gravity can be provided by selecting the species type on the device. These moisture meters correct for the wood temperature internally. The reliable range of estimating moisture for the commercial conductance electrodes is 6 percent to 30 percent, and for capacitance moisture meters is 4 percent to 30 percent. Readings above 30 percent should be considered qualitative.(2)Data ProcessingDepending on the temperature during testing, conductivity measured by the conductance-type electrodes may need correction for the temperature effects.Data InterpretationThe moisture content of wood does not provide direct information about the presence of decay, but it suggests the potential for decay. Moisture contents above 20 percent indicate the potential for decay with significant decay at moisture contents above 30 percent. The presence of salt in wood due to treatment with salt-based preservatives or longtime exposure to seawater can result in inaccurate moisture content measurements.AdvantagesSome of the advantages of moisture content measurement include the following:Simplicity.Low cost.Well-established field inspection technique.Quantitative information provided about the moisture content of wood members, which is a key biotic requirement for sustaining decay activity.LimitationsSome limitations of moisture content measurement include the following:Moisture content measurement is not a direct measure of decay.Conductance-type meters may not be useful for wood treated with salt-based preservatives, exposure to seawater, and treated with fire retardants.Additional testing is needed to confirm the presence of decay.ReferencesWhite, R.

Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT),"Bridge - Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT)Target of InvestigationPAUT can be applied to detect cracks and weld flaws in steel bridge members. The technology is typically implemented using longitudinal (straight beam) or shear wave (angled beam) methods.Longitudinal wave methods are used to test surfaces not available for visual assessment, such as detecting cracks in bridge pins, trunnion shafts, or eyebars. Longitudinal wave methods may also be used for measuring the thickness of a steel plate to detect section loss or for imaging corrosion pits.Shear wave methods (angled beam) are commonly used to inspect welds for flaws (figure 1).Figure 1. Illustration. PAUT Transducer Mounted on an Angled Wedge and Beam Paths for Inspecting a Butt Weld.DescriptionPAUT is a nondestructive evaluation technology used to detect defects such as cracks and weld flaws in steel bridge components. The technology uses acoustic waves launched from a transducer which propagate through the material and are reflected from discontinuities in the material. The reflected waves are detected by the transducer and analyzed. PAUT transducers are comprised of a number of sensor elements that generate and detect acoustic waves. Each individual element in the transducer launches an acoustic wave which combines in the material being tested to allow the resulting ultrasonic beam to be steered in different directions or focused at different depths. The ability to steer the ultrasonic beam in different directions increases the volume of material insonified from a single transducer position. This allows the technology to direct acoustic energy toward a particular location in the material being tested, allowing the wave beam to be scanned across the area where cracking is likely to initiate The beam steering capabilities of PAUT also provide full volumetric coverage of difficult to access areas.Physical PrinciplePAUT detects defects using the same physical principles as conventional UT, launching an acoustic wave from a transducer and analyzing reflections from discontinuities and the physical boundaries of the material being tested. Conventional UT launches waves from a single element and receives (detects) waves using a single element. In contrast to conventional UT, PAUT uses multiple sensor elements to launch and receive acoustic waves. The physical principle of wave interference is used to combine waves launched from the individual sensors to form a beam of acoustic energy that propagates in a desired direction. This allows the wave beam direction to be controlled and “steered” in a desired direction or focused at a desired distance from a PAUT transducer.Wave interference occurs when two or more acoustic waves occupy the same space at the same point in time. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of constructive interference on the amplitude of an acoustic wave. If wave A and wave B occupy the same space and are in phase as shown in the figure, these individual waves will combine to form a wave with an amplitude equal to the sum of the two individual wave amplitudes. This phenomenon is known asconstructive interference. PAUT utilizes this phenomenon by launching waves from several individual sensor elements at different points in time, so the interference between the individual waves results in a plane wave propagating in a certain direction within the material being tested.(1)Figure 2. Graph. Constructive Wave Interference, Where Wave A is In-Phase with Wave B, Resulting in a Combined Wave (A+B).Figure 3 illustrates the wave interference phenomenon used to control the direction of an acoustic wave beam launched from a series of individual sensor elements. In the figure, the sensor elements are represented as point sources for acoustic waves. Acoustic waves are launched from each individual sensor as the result of an excitation pulse. These excitation pulses are delayed in time (i.e., phased) to result in constructive interference of the individual waves within the material. In this manner, the acoustic wavefront can be “steered” or focused at a particular depth into the material by modifying the delay between the pulses from the individual sensors.Figure 3. Illustration. The Generation of a Plane Wave by Sequential Excitation of Individual Sensor Elements.Data AcquisitionPAUT utilizes transducers comprised of multiple sensor elements that launch and receive acoustic waves in the material being tested. Pulser circuitry in the instrument controls electronic pulses so individual sensors are excited at different points in time to transmit acoustic waves into the material being tested. This allows the shape and direction of the resulting beam of acoustic energy to be controlled so the beam may be steered at different angles or focused at different depths in the materials. Receiver circuitry in the instrument applies electronic delay to each sensor element to match the beam shape formed by the pulser. The received waveforms from each sensor may be combined into a single acoustic signal. This signal is digitized and stored in the computer.Figure 4 shows a photograph of a typical PAUT instrument being used in the field (bottom). The battery-operated instrument contains the pulser-reciever circuitry and supporting software necessary to achieve beam forming, detect and store resulting waveforms, and produce different presentations of the data. A typical phased array transducer (top) attached to a refracting wedge that allows for angled beam testing using shear waves.Figure 4.  Photo. PAUT Instrument Transducer used to launch Angled Beams.Data ProcessingWaveforms received by the transducer are digitized and stored. These data are presented in a variety of formats for interpretation by the operator. Common presentations include A-scans, displaying a single waveform, and sectorial scans, displaying the results of multiple waveforms combined to form a color-coded image.The A-scan display shown in figure 5 presents waveform amplitude versus time, the typical data presentation for conventional ultrasonic pulse-echo technologies.A sectorial scan displays a color representation of wave amplitudes detected by the transducer. The display is formed from the combination of numerous A-scans captured as the beam is steered at different angles. To form the sectorial scan, the amplitude of each data point in an A-scan is assigned a color from a defined color palette (shown to the right of the sectorial scan in figure 5). The color representation of the amplitude of each individual A-scan produced as the wave beam is steered through the desired angles is then plotted. Using this graphical representation, indications that cause high amplitude reflections as the wave beam is steered through the desired angles appear as two-dimensional features on the sectorial scan. Data may also be presented in a C-scan format when a two-dimensional scanner is used to scan the transducer across the surface of the material being tested. The C-scan format presents the linear ordinate of the transducer on the x-axis and the color-coded amplitude of the A-scans across the transducer aperture plotted on the vertical axis. A spatial image showing areas of section loss and/or deep corrosion pits is produced.Figure 5. Composite Graph. Data Display from a PAUT Instrument.Data InterpretationData is interpreted in the same manner for PAUT as for conventional pulse-echo UT. The amplitude of reflected waves is compared with a standard to assess if a given indication is acceptable or unacceptable. If a linear encoder is used during the data collection process, the length of indications may be estimated based on the data collected and stored.AdvantagesCan detect both surface and subsurface flaws.Can assess areas that are inaccessible for visual inspection.Improved volumetric coverage and greater flexibility for testing complex geometries.Complete data records stored for future reference.LimitationsRequires surface preparation.Requires well-trained and experienced operators.Increased cost of equipment as compared to conventional UT.ReferencesOlympus NDT, Inc.

Probing,"Bridge - ProbingTarget of investigationsProbing is beneficial in investigating the near-surface decay of wood members and estimating the depth of splits and checks—inherent defects of timber and sawn lumber.DescriptionProbing involves using a moderately sharp object, such as an awl, pocketknife, or pick hammer, to locate the near-surface decay of wood members. Deteriorated wood may show excessive softness, less resistance against the probe penetration, and a different breaking pattern compared to sound wood.(1)When lifting a small sliver of wood with a pick or pocketknife, decayed wood breaks abruptly, while sound wood splinters.(2)In addition, probing with flat-bladed probes such as feeler gauges, which are typically graduated in centimeters and/or inches, can be used to estimate the depth of splits or checks in wood members.(1)Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.A.

Methods of probing.Physical PrincipleBecause wood tends to exhibit excessive softness as it deteriorates, the resistance of wood against probing with a moderately sharp object can provide information about the decay of a member. Probing can also provide information about the depth of splits and checks.Data AcquisitionDepending on the purpose of the inspection, an awl, pocketknife, or pick hammer can be used for probing.Data ProcessingNo data processing is requiredData InterpretationCare must be taken to differentiate between water-softened wood and deteriorated wood. Probing may not be effective for assessing deterioration in low-hardness wood members such as the ones made from western red cedar.(1)AdvantagesProbing advantages include the following:Simplicity.Low cost.Sensitivity to the moderate and advanced level of deterioration.LimitationsSome of the limitations of probing include the following:Probing is mainly sensitive to near-surface decay.Probing may not be an effective tool in low-hardness wood species.Probing does not provide quantitative information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood members.ReferencesWhite, R.

Radiography (RAD Tendons),"Bridge - Radiography (RAD Tendons)Target of InvestigationRadiography can be used for the following applications:Determining the positions, diameters, and condition of tendons and strands in post-tensioned and prestressed concrete girders.Detecting voids in cast-in-place, precast prestressed concrete girders.Assessing the grouting condition in the post-tensioning ducts.DescriptionConcrete radiography is similar to radiography used to produce medical x rays. This method involves gaining information in a test object by subjecting it to high energy electromagnetic radiation. The propagation of radiation through the test object is captured on a special photographic film on the opposite side of the specimen to produce a photograph like representation of the internal structure of the concrete.Physical PrincipleThe basic concept of gamma-ray radiography is illustrated in figure 1. A source transfers gamma-ray energy to a collimator through a guide tube by means of a telecontrol unit so that gamma rays impinge on the sample to be inspected. On the other side of the sample, an image plate registers the gamma-ray intensity traversing the sample. The lower the density of the material is, the higher the intensity of the gamma-ray energy that reaches the plate will be.Figure 1. Illustration. Gamma-Ray Radiography Concept.Since concrete is about 2.5 times denser than biological tissues, x rays used in medicine are not suitable for concrete members. For this reason, concrete radiography usually employs gamma-ray sources instead of x-ray generators such as are used in medicine. Another advantage of gamma rays over x rays is gamma rays are emitted spontaneously by certain substances so electrical power is not required. An additional advantage of the192Ir source is it can be housed in a small and relatively light container (~ 20 kg, 44lb).The penetration of the gamma ray energy depends on its wavelength and energy level. The higher the source energy is, the greater the penetration of the gamma ray energy will be.Figure 2 shows how voids are readily identified by using the radiographic method. An empty soda bottle embedded in a concrete block irradiated with gamma rays from a192Ir source can be readily identified. The attenuation produced by voids (air) is negligible. Hence radiation transmitted through a void in the interior of a concrete sample will produce a “shadow” darker than the areas where radiation traverses the full thickness of the concrete sample.Figure 2. Radiograph. Empty Soda Bottle Embedded in a Concrete Block Irradiated with Gamma Rays From a192Ir Source.Since steel attenuates gamma ray energy more than concrete, steel elements such as rebars or strands embedded in a concrete sample project a lighter “shadow” on the image plate. A severely corroded rebar with a nonuniform cross section projects on the image plate non-uniformly (figure 3). These are radiographs of a slab (left) and a tank wall (right) obtained with a192Ir source. The radiograph on the left hand side also shows an electrical conduit to the right of a corroded rebar. The red lines in the lower part display the photographic density along the “cuts,” indicated by the blue lines on the radiograph. They help visualize the reduced cross section due to corrosion.Figure 3. Composite Graph. Radiograph of a Distorted Rebar Profile.Data AcquisitionImage plates, either conventional or more modern computed radiography (CR) image plates, record the gamma ray energy penetrated to the opposite side of a sample emitted from a192Ir,137Cs, or60Co source. Conventional image plates must be developed after exposure, while CR image plates are converted into digitized images. The recording resolution of the CR image plates is about 5 times greater than that of conventional image plates. Plate size is usually 35 cm by 43 cm (14 inches by 17 inches).Data ProcessingFigure 4 shows the detail obtained in an inspection done with the radiographic method of a post-tensioned box girder.(1)The horizontal band near the center is a post-tensioned cable. The impression of the duct can be seen in the insert. The other white lines in the right picture correspond to ordinary reinforcement, while the white rectangle is an external reference. These pictures show that this method is an appropriate tool for studying profiles of cables and ducts in post-tensioned and precast prestressed concrete girders. The quantitative determination of profiling defects is discussed below.In the case of traditional radiographic methods where the image plates are film, the recorded data are the photographic density values at each point of the plate. The density is determined by measuring the intensity of the light transmitted through the plate when the plate is illuminated from the opposite side with a light source of constant and uniform intensity. The density is then compared with the expected value for a given configuration using a least squares fitting procedure to determine the profile of the tendon and the nature and extension of defects in the tendons as illustrated in figure 4. In the case of CR image plates, the gray level of each pixel is equivalent to density.Figure 4. Composite Graph. Radiograph of a Distorted Rebar Profile.Data InterpretationFigure 5 shows an example of profiling tendons in post-tensioned concrete girders using film radiography. The girder contains two ducts, one of them having a severe grouting defect.(2)The data interpretation involves examining the densityD(xo,z),wherexois thex-coordinate of the vertical dotted line in the radiograph in figure 5. The data points in the plot on the right hand side of figure 5 are the values ofD(xo,z).Figure 5. Composite Graph. Interpretation of Radiograph.(2)In the right figure, the “bowl” shapes in the intervals A-B and D-E correspond to the cables. The “peak density,” corresponding to the dark band above the cable in the upper duct, is the manifestation of a void in this duct. The thin line in the right plot corresponds to the calculated density values.The parameters in red were adjusted to fit the data. The positions and diameters of cables and ducts were obtained from the measured data and by tomographic analysis. The obtained value of the “void” density determines the depth of the void as 5 cm air equivalent, and the small difference between the measured and calculatedDvalues in the interval D-E may be an indication that the cable section is reduced by up to about 7 mm.AdvantagesProduces “photographic” quality results and precise locating of reinforcement for condition assessment, void detection, and grout condition assessment.Small, portable source systems.Some source systems, such as those employed with192Ir source, are easy to shield and Can be used in the field without interrupting traffic or causing disturbances to the general public.LimitationsRequires precautionary measures against gamma rays. Public exposure to radiations must always be below the limits set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and State regulations.Small, portable gamma ray source systems can only penetrate concrete elements of the thickness up to about 300 mm. Systems that can emit more energy must be used for thicker elements.ReferencesPimentel, M., et. al., “Gamma-Ray Inspection of Post Tensioning Cables in a Concrete Bridge,” Structural Faults and Repair 2010, 13th International Conference, Edinburgh, June 2010.Mariscotti, M.A.J., et. al., “Gamma-Ray Imaging for Void and Corrosion Assessment,”Concrete International, Vol. 31, No. 11, November 2009, pp.48-53.The data shown in this article are taken from studies carried out by THASA (www.thasa.com)."

Plate size is usually 35 cm by 43 cm (14 inches by 17 inches).Data ProcessingFigure 4 provides an example of a concrete wall with honeycombing. Visual inspection of the image plate is usually enough for detecting voids. A more detailed quantitative analysis can be carried out by examining the photographic densityD(x,z)(i.e., the “gray” level) along differentzi-lines.Figure 4. Radiograph. Concrete Wall with Honeycombing.(1)Data InterpretationData interpretation for detecting voids is straightforward. Voids visually manifest as relatively darker areas in the radiograph of a concrete sample. However, other phenomena can result in relatively darker images. For instance, relative to the lighter shadow projected by reinforcing bars, the rest of the plate will appear darker. These situations are easily identified since the rebars project a well-defined shape. Another, more subtle effect is due to the intensity of the radiation falling onto the plate being not only a function of the attenuation of the materials it traverses but also of the inverse of the square of the gamma-ray path lengthd. Ifdis comparable to the dimensions(x,z)of the plate, the radiation intensity will be noticeably higher, producing a darker zone near the point at whichdis smallest. That is the point(xo,zo)at which the line from the source perpendicular to the plate intersects the plate. In these cases, the photographic densityD(x,z)on the plate will diminish regularly as(x,z)is farther from(xo,zo),exhibiting circles of equal photographic density.Figure 5 shows an example where these two effects combine to make identifying a void difficult. The radiograph in figure 5 corresponds to a concrete structure with several rebars (numbered vertical light gray bands) and a few stirrups (horizontal light gray lines). The small white rectangle with black dots, the label above it and the thin vertical metallic segment are external reference elements.The source-to-plate distance in this measurement was only 22 cm. In order to determine whether the darker area at the center of the radiograph corresponds to a void or not, the photographic density along the dotted line was measured (red data points in the lower plot) and compared with the expected (calculated) photographic density.The green and magenta lines on the graph in figure 5 are the calculated photographic densities with and without steel bars. The good agreement between the measured data and the calculations indicates that the dark areas extending from near the center towards the borders of the radiograph are not due to a void but rather to the variation of the gamma-ray path length among the different pointsFigure 5. Composite Graph. Radiograph and Data Interpretation.(2)AdvantagesProduces “photographic” quality results and precise locating of reinforcement for condition assessment, void detection, and grout condition assessment.Small, portable source systems.Some source systems, such as those employed with192Ir source, are easy to shield and Can be used in the field without interrupting traffic or causing disturbances to the general public.LimitationsRequires precautionary measures against gamma rays. Public exposure to radiations must always be below the limits set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and State regulations.Small, portable gamma ray source systems can only penetrate concrete elements of the thickness up to about 300 mm. Systems that can emit more energy must be used for thicker elements.ReferencesMariscotti, M.A.J., et. al., “Gamma-Ray Imaging for Void and Corrosion Assessment,”Concrete International, Vol. 31, No. 11, November 2009, pp.48-53.The data shown in this article are taken from studies carried out by THASA (www.thasa.com)."
Resistance Microdrilling,"Bridge - Resistance MicrodrillingTarget of investigationsResistance microdrilling is the preferred drilling and coring technique for identifying and quantifying defects, voids, and deterioration (i.e., termite galleries) in wood structures.(1)DescriptionResistance microdrilling measures the electrical power consumption of a motor as it rotates the needle.The diameter of the needles (drill bits) at the shaft is 0.06 inch (1.5 mm) and at the tip is 0.12 inch (3.0 mm). The flat end bit (figure 1) moves through a wood member at a known rate and generates resistance information to determine the depth and extent of low-resistance areas at high precision.Physical PrincipleThe electrical consumption of the resistance drill is proportional to the mechanical torque applied to the needle and mainly depends on the wood density. In other words, resistance microdrilling detects the low-density regions of wood potentially caused by decay and deterioration.(1)Data AcquisitionResistance microdrills collect and store data electronically, and they can provide a chart or a hard copy representing the relative resistance of wood over the drilling path.(1)Recent models have capabilities to visualize data on a tablet or cell phone during field testing. The data can be further analyzed in the office. Depending on the density of the wood species, sound regions of wood show different levels of resistance. In contrast, voids show zero resistance against drilling (figure 2). Through observing the variation of resistance during drilling, an inspector can identify and quantify the extent of decay as low, moderate, or severe in wood members. After drilling, the drilling hole is typically filled with a small amount of silicone sealant or marine adhesive.(1)While resistance microdrilling is typically performed perpendicular to wood members, it is also possible to drill a member at an angle to assess the condition of wood below the ground line, shown in figure 3.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 1. End of resistance microdrill needles (bits)[1].Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 2. Data. Resistance microdrill data for a southern yellow pine piling with decay region between 8–10 inches on the drilling path (yellow arrow). The decayed area shows substantially lower resistance against drilling.(1)Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.A. Resistance microdrilling perpendicular to the member surface.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.B. Resistance microdrilling at an angle.Figure 3. Photos. Perpendicular and angled Resistance microdrilling.(1)Data ProcessingDrilling charts should be reviewed by the inspector in the field, and notes should be taken on the charts to identify the location of drilling The instrument is often equipped with a laptop and software for a better observation of the data (figure 2).Data InterpretationCare must be taken not to interpret the sound of softwood (i.e., conifers) as decayed wood. The center section of the softwood (close to the pitch) is often softer than its outer section because it lacks the growth rings present in the outer region.(1)The type of wood being drilled matters. While the resistance of hardwood can be greater than 50 percent, the resistance of softwood can vary in the range of 15–50-plus percent. Drilling should be performed across the whole cross section of the member because some wood species may show constantly low resistance during the test.The drilling resistance from different manufacturers can be substantially different due to factors such as different scales applied to the data. A guideline for determining various decay levels is presented in table 1.(1)Table 1. Guideline for estimating the decay level of Douglas-fir and southern yellow pine using the resistance microdrill data [1].Resistance level (%) *Decay levelComments> 20+None to lowSound wood often shows consistent resistance across the full width5-15ModerateIt often represents areas near void0SevereTypically represents voids*Values can substantially vary between manufacturers.AdvantagesAdvantages of resistance microdrilling include the following:Resistance microdrilling provides quantitative data about the condition of wood members.Resistance microdrilling is simple.Resistance microdrilling provides an accurate depth of decay.Resistance microdrilling is well developed.Resistance microdrilling does not require access to the opposing side of wood members.LimitationsSome of the limitations of resistance microdrilling include the following:This technique involves localized measurements.The test is mainly used to confirm the presence of decay but can also be used to determine depth of checks.The accessibility to the member of interest can be limited. There must be enough space for fitting the drill and drilling through the entire thickness of a member.(2)Typically, this is not an issue with bridges, where an inspector can drill vertically from the bottom side upward, even in the case of closely paced bridge girders.The weight of the device can cause fatigue for the inspector after several drillings.(2)The intended drill path can deflect from a straight line when the drill bit is boring tangentially to the growth rings.ReferencesWhite, R.

Screw Withdrawal Testing,"Bridge - Screw Withdrawal TestingTarget of investigationsScrew withdrawal testing has been developed to assess the biological deterioration (i.e., fungal decay) in wood members.(1)DescriptionScrew withdrawal testing aims to provide information about the wood’s physical and mechanical properties by measuring the maximum load required to pull out the screw.Physical PrincipleBecause wood biologically deteriorates, it tends to soften and experience a reduction in specific gravity. Thus, it shows less resistance against screw withdrawal.Data AcquisitionTo measure the withdrawal resistance, first, a screw is driven perpendicular to the wood surface, and the force used to pull out the screw is recorded. The withdrawal resistance is related to the density, modulus of elasticity, modulus of rupture, and shear modulus. (figure 1).(1)While the screw withdrawal results are mainly affected by the local properties of a wood member, results from the sound and deteriorated locations can help evaluate the condition of timber structures such as bridges.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.A.    A commercial screw withdrawal resistance unit.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.KD = kiln-dried; MAP = monoammonium phosphate; MOR = modulus of rupture;MPa = megapascals; PA = phosphoric acid.B.

Stress Wave Timing,"Bridge - Stress Wave TimingTarget of investigationsStress wave timing is used to detect the areas of internal decay in wood structures.DescriptionStress wave timing aims to investigate the presence of flaws and decay in wood materials by determining the travel time of stress waves as they propagate from the source to the receiver.Physical PrincipleIn undamaged materials, the velocity of stress waves is directly proportional to their elastic modulus. In the presence of flaws, such as checks and splits, however, the velocity tends to decrease and stress wave timing tends to increase.  Therefore, waves need to take a longer travel path from the source to the receiver to bypass the flawed region. Furthermore, due to the increased softness of decayed wood, it generally takes longer for stress waves to travel in decayed wood than sound wood of the same type. It is worth noting that since wood is an anisotropic material, its mechanical properties (and subsequently stress wave velocity) are affected by the orientation of propagating waves with respect to grains. Moisture and preservative treatment can also affect the stress wave timing results. In the following paragraphs, factors affecting the stress wave timing results are explained in further detail.Fiber orientationThe direction of the stress waves propagating in a wood member affects the wave velocity measurements.(1)For structural wood members, fibers are oriented more or less along the length of a member. During measurements, tapping the end grain of a wood member generates longitudinal waves with the highest wave velocity (lowest stress wave transmission time), while tapping the side of a wood member (i.e., across grains) generates transverse waves with the lowest wave velocity (largest stress wave transmission time). For example, for Douglas fir and southern pine, the stress wave transmission times along the grain are approximately 200 µs/m (60 µs/ft), while the transmission times across grains are in the range of 850 µs/m and 1,000 µs/m (259 µs/ft and 305 µs/ft).(1)Ring orientationThe stress wave transmission time is shortest at the radial direction and longest at 45 degrees to the annual ring orientation (figure 1).(1)In the radial direction, transmission time is approximately 30 percent shorter than 45 degrees to the annual ring orientation.(1)For good quality wood at 12 percent moisture content, the transmission time of 668 μs/m (203 µs/ft) in the radial direction, 800 μs/m (244 µs/ft) in the tangential direction, and 995 μs/m (303 µs/ft) in the 45 degrees to the annual ring orientation is expected (figure 1). Depending on the wood species, these values can vary ±10 percent.(1)For glulam (also known as glued laminated timber) members, the transmission time for each layer can vary depending on the ring orientation.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.A. Travel paths.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.B. Transmission time affected by the orientation of annual rings.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.C. Typical transmission times in a glulam member.Figure 1. Schematics and Graph. Transverse stress waves in timber. The annual ring orientation in the first top two layers is mainly radial, in the second top two layers—mainly 45 degrees, and in the third top two layers is mainly tangential.(1)DecayThe presence of decay significantly affects the transmission time across wood grains, while it may not substantially affect the transmission time parallel to grains. A 30 percent increase in transmission time perpendicular to grain suggests 50 percent strength loss, and a 50 percent increase of transmission time perpendicular to grain indicates severe decay.(1)Transverse travel paths are best suited for finding decay. Parallel-to-grain travel paths can bypass regions of decay.Moisture contentThe stress wave transmission time perpendicular to the grain tends to decrease with moisture content below the fiber saturation point (FSP), approximately 30 percent, and it remains relatively constant for moisture levels higher than FSP (figure 2).(1)Depending on the moisture content and temperature of the wood during testing, adjustment factors can be applied to the transmission time results (table 1).(1)Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 2.

However, depending on the penetration depth, oil-borne preservatives can increase the transmission time of stress waves up to 40 percent higher than that of the untreated wood.(1)The depth of preservative penetration in round poles generally varies between 37 and 61 mm (1.5 to 2.5 inch).(1)Table 2 shows an example of the estimated transmission times for poles of varying diameter as the penetration depth of preservatives varies.Table 2.

Because both accelerometers are connected to the stress timer, the time difference between generating and receiving the signal is recorded (figure 3).Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 3. Schematic. Illustration of the principle of stress wave timing tests.(1)The use of stress wave timing for locating defects in timber structures is limited by accessing both sides of a member. This technique is particularly useful for assessing sawn lumber or glulam timber members with a thickness greater than or equal to 3.5 inches, where hammer sounding is not effective.(1)Depending on the frequency of excitation, the stress waves are referred to as sonic or ultrasonic. Sonic frequencies are between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, and ultrasonic frequencies are greater than 20 kHz. The application of a hammer and accelerometers for generating and receiving stress waves is mainly limited to the sonic frequencies. For generating and receiving ultrasonic waves, piezoelectric transducers should be used. Couplant is also required for attaching the transducers to the member when using ultrasonic measurement systems. Stress timing units generally produce comparable results when calibrated following the manufacturer’s recommendations.(1)Data ProcessingNo data processing is requiredData InterpretationIn the physical principle section, several factors affecting the stress wave transmission time were discussed. For field applications, as a first step, a baseline transmission time (Tbaseline(µs)) using the wave transmission distance (WTD) for differentiating between sound versus potentially decayed wood should be defined. Transmission times smaller thanTbaseline(µs) indicate sound wood, while those larger thanTbaseline(µs) suggest potentially degraded members. WTD is a member thickness for the transverse wave transmission time measurements, and 1,000 (µs/m) can be used as a general baseline transmission time when WTD is expressed in meters. Similarly, 300 (µs/ft) is the general baseline transmission time when WTD is expressed in feet. A baseline transmission time can also be determined onsite by testing sound sections of the wood members.Stress wave timing techniques should be used in areas with a high chance of deterioration, such as near bearings points and connections. The general baseline transmission time serves as a starting point in the inspection. Tests should be performed at various distances from the region of interest. The stress wave transmission times for sound wood show small variations. If substantial variations are observed in test results, the member should be specified as suspect.(1)AdvantagesSome advantages of stress wave timing include the following:The technique provides information about the physical and mechanical properties of wood because the wood elastic modulus is inversely proportional to the stress wave timing values.The technique is well developed and easy to use.The technique is appropriate for testing thick timber members where hammer sounding is not effective.LimitationsLimitations of stress wave timing include the following:Training is required.Access to both sides of a wood member are required.Affects results due to defects other than decay, such as internal checks, cracks, and splits.Takes extra time since measurements need to be performed at multiple locations.ReferencesWhite, R.

Transverse Vibration of Structural Systems,"Bridge - Transverse Vibration of Structural SystemsTarget of investigationsUnlike other nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques used for the condition assessment of individual members, transverse vibration of structural systems aims to provide information about the condition of a structure. This technique is useful because inspecting each member of a structural system is time-consuming, and sometimes accessing wood members can be difficult.(1)DescriptionTransverse vibration aims to capture the resonance frequency of a structural system, such as a timber bridge superstructure, and use it to estimate theEIof the system, whereEis the elastic modulus, andIis the moment of inertia (inch4or m4).(1,2)EIrepresents the system’s condition.Physical PrincipleAccording to the transverse vibration results from the laboratory and field bridges, the vibration response of single-span bridges can be modeled using the theory for simply supported one-way beams.(2)For a timber beam, the theoretical relationship betweenEand the resonance frequency (fr) is as follows:Figure 1. Equation. The theoretical relationship betweenEand the resonance frequency (fr).WhereWis the beam weight (lb or kg),Lis the beam span (inch or m),gis the gravitational acceleration, andnis related to the support condition. For a simply supported beam,n= 2.46, and for a fixed-supported beam,n= 12.65.(1)For an undamaged system, an agreement between test results and the theoretical value is expected. However, as a structural system deteriorates, itsEItends to decrease, and it deviates from its theoretical value.(1)Data AcquisitionTo estimate the resonance frequency, free or forced vibration can be applied to a structural system. In free vibration, the excitation force is impacted by a large hammer to deflect the structure, while in forced vibration, a motor with an eccentric rotating mass excites the structure. In the forced vibration, the resonance frequency is estimated by changing the speed of the rotating mass to observe the maximum deflection in the structure. The deflection can be estimated using linear variable differential transducers (LVDT) attached to the structure and connected to an oscilloscope.(1,2)Similarly, an LVDT can be used to capture the deflection during the free vibration testing (also known as modal testing.(2))Data ProcessingIn practice, the output of the oscilloscope—time-deflection data—is used to estimatethe resonance frequency.(1)Using equation 1, the resonance frequency enables estimating the   with 95 percent confidence, which allows for variability due to materials and construction. Then, by measuring the floor span (L) and estimating the weight of the flooring, EI can be calculated to represent the condition of the structural system.(1)Data InterpretationNo data interpretation is requiredAdvantagesTransverse vibration of structural systems includes the following advantages:Provides information about the condition of the whole bridge system.Saves time and eliminates accessibility issues compared to individual testing of bridge components.Focuses on the quality of connections, while the majority of NDE techniques focus on the quality of individual members.LimitationsSome of the limitations with transverse vibration include the following:The current method of analysis is limited to single-span bridge systems.The test evaluates the overall condition of a structure and fails to provide information about the condition of bridge components.ReferencesWhite, R.

Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW),"Bridge - Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW)Target of InvestigationThe ultrasonic surface waves (USW) technique has the following applications:(1)Concrete quality control and evaluation (modulus and strength, using the correlation with modulus).Indirect assessment of delamination in bridge decks.Estimates of the depth of vertical cracks within bridge decks or other elements.Condition assessment through evaluating probable material damage from various causes: alkali-silica reaction (ASR), fire, freeze-thaw, and other cracking processes.DescriptionThe USW technique is an offshoot of the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) method used in evaluating material properties (elastic moduli) in the very near surface zone. SASW utilizes the phenomenon of the surface wave dispersion, i.e., velocity of propagation as a function of frequency and wavelength, in layered systems to obtain information about layer thickness and elastic moduli.(2)The USW test is identical to the SASW test except that the frequency range of interest is limited to a narrow high frequency range where the velocity of the surface wave (phase velocity) does not vary significantly with frequency. The surface wave velocity can be converted to the material modulus, concrete modulus in the case of bridge decks, using either the measured or assumed mass density or Poisson’s ratio of the material. A USW test consists of recording the response of the deck at two receiver locations due to an impact on the surface of the deck.Figure 1. Photo. Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW) Equipment.(2)Physical PrincipleSurface waves are elastic waves that travel along the free surface of a medium and, in most cases, is the predominant part of energy in comparison to body waves—compressive (P- waves) and shear waves (Swaves).(2)The arrival of the surface (Rayleigh) wave follows the arrival of the two body wave components because it is the slowest one (figure 2).Figure 2. Graph. Typical Time Record Used in Surface-Wave Method.(2)The surface waves propagate radially from the impact source, forming a cylindrical front with a velocity dependent on the elastic properties of the medium. The waves propagating in a heterogeneous medium are dispersive; that is, waves of different wavelengths or frequencies travel with different velocities. Thus, the information about the subsurface can be obtained through measuring the phase velocity versus frequency relationship (dispersion curve) and back calculation of the dispersion curve to obtain the profile of the tested system.Surface wave energy extends to a depth of approximately one wavelength. At wavelengths less than or equal to the thickness of the layer, the velocity of surface-wave propagation is more or less independent of wavelength (figure 3). Therefore, if the measurement is limited to wavelengths not exceeding the thickness of the deck, the velocity of surface waves will be dependent only on the concrete modulus. An average velocity is used to correlate it to the concrete modulus. Significant variation in the phase velocity indicates the presence of delamination or other anomaly. Elastic waves are generated by means of impacts, detected by a pair or an array of receivers and recorded by a transient recorder.Figure 3. Illustration. Surface-wave Velocity vs. Wavelength (top) and Evaluation of a Layer Modulus by SASW (USW) Method (bottom).(2)Data AcquisitionThe basic components of USW equipment include a source, at least one pair of receivers, and a portable computer with controls and data acquisition software.(1)The USW equipment enables both automatic and semi-automatic data collection and data processing. Figure 4 shows an example of a simple USW device, called portable seismic property analyzer (PSPA), with a solenoid type impact source and two receivers (accelerometers). Once the device is placed on the ground, a series of impacts from the source is detected by the receiver pair and recorded on a portable computer.Figure 4. Photo. USW Testing Using PSPA in a Mobile Cart.(1)Data ProcessingIn most systems, compressional waves arrive at the receivers first, followed by shear waves and then surface waves.(3)However, more than two-thirds of the energy in the wave train is in the surface waves, making them more easily studied. Figure 5 illustrates the relative arrival of the wave train at a near and far receiver. Figure 6 shows how a phase lag in the arrival of a wave component to two or more receiver locations can be used to measure the travel time between them. The received signals are processed, and a subsequent calculation scheme is used to calculate the concrete modulus directly in the field (figure 7).(4Figure 5. Graph. Recorded Waveforms.(3)Figure 6. Illustration. Velocity Calculation.(3)Figure 7. Photo. Testing Device (left) and Screen (right) During Data Collection.(2)Data InterpretationData from USW testing are typically presented in terms of the concrete modulus distribution (figure 8). Very low modulus is often an indication of presence of delamination or cracking and does not necessarily represent the actual concrete modulus at the test location.Figure 8. Contour Map. Concrete Modulus Distribution from USW Testing.(5)AdvantagesRepeatable.Provides modulus of the concrete for appropriate design.Can take the place of lab testing of cores or cylinders.Can be conducted within hours of construction.Can characterize the depth of vertical cracks.LimitationsSlower data collection.Road and bridge closures necessary for surveying existing pavements.Expertise and training required for equipment setup, data collection, data processing, and data interpretation.Higher level expertise and experience required to interpret test results for concrete deck deteriorations such as debonding/delamination.More complicated SASW modulus evaluation for layered systems like decks with asphalt concrete overlays.ReferencesGucunski, N., et. al.,Nondestructive Testing to Identify Concrete Bridge Deck Deterioration, Report S2-Ro6A-RR-1, SHRP2 Renewal Research, Transportation Research Board, 2013.Gucunski, N., et.al.,Comprehensive Bridge Deck Deterioration Mapping of Nine Bridges by Nondestructive Evaluation Technologies, Project SPR-NDEB(90)-8H-00, Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation, Rutgers University, January, 2011.Central Federal Lands Highway, “Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) and Ultra Sonic Surface Wave (USW) Methods,” (Website) Lakewood, CO.

Ultrasonic Tomography (UST),"Pavements - Ultrasonic Tomography (UST)Target of InvestigationRegarding concrete pavement, ultrasonic tomography (UST) can be used for the following applications:Measuring the thickness of the surface course.Detecting reinforcement locations.Evaluating distresses, such as delamination, honeycombing, and voids, in the surface course.UST can be used in the following ways for asphalt pavements and overlays when the asphalt mix is cold and stiff:Measuring the thickness of the surface layer.Detecting delamination and debonding.DescriptionUST uses high-frequency (greater than 20,000 Hz) horizontal shear waves to characterize properties of or detect defects in the materials. Dry-point contact transducers generate ultrasonic waves that travel through the material and are received at different locations on the surface. Information about the material being tested can be acquired by propagating a signal through it and analyzing the signals acquired by the receivers. Figure 1 shows a state-of-the-art UST device for imaging concrete structures. It utilizes a 4- by 12-transducer array to perform a measurement in less than 3 s; this measurement results in a two-dimensional (2D) depth profile (B-scan).(1)The transducers provide the required consistency of impact and wavefront penetration for diagnostics up to 3 ft deep.(1)In evaluating heterogeneous materials, such as portland cement concrete or asphalt, the multiple sensor pairs in each scan allow for the necessary data redundancy. The signal is reflected by the interface of materials with different acoustic impedances, enabling the detection of concrete slab thicknesses, rebar locations, and anomalies in the surface course of a pavement.Source: FHWA.A. Top view.Source: FHWA.B. Bottom view.Figure 1. Photos. Ultrasonic tomographer.Physical PrincipleUltrasonic shear waves propagate through the surveyed material and reflect off interfaces of objects of different acoustic impedances. As illustrated in figure 2, the transducer probe generates the waves while the receiving probe detects and records the reflected waves. Velocities of the waves in the material are calibrated by the transducers at fixed distances. The depth of the reflector (e.g., an internal flaw such as cracking, voids, delamination, or horizontal cracking) is measured through the two-way travel time of the pulse using the wave-propagation velocity in the investigated material.(2)Source: FHWA.d= depth.Figure 2. Illustration. Physical principle of ultrasonic pulse echo.The 66 ray paths (each corresponding to an A-scan) involved during a measurement with UST at one test location are shown in figure 3. The UST uses the synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) for analysis in scan mode to reconstruct the material being tested based on the shear‑wave reflections and to create a B-scan.(3,4)A B-scan is a 2D display of echo intensity versus depth along the aperture. The positions with high intensity are areas where there is a change in acoustic impedance, which could be an interface between two materials or defects in the material.© 2018 Acoustic Control System—ACS Group, Germany.Figure 3. Illustration. Transmission and reception of shear waves in UST.Data AcquisitionTo carry out a detailed inspection with a tomographer, the user lays out a series of parallel scan lines on the testing surface. If the whole interior of the material is to be examined, the distance between the scan lines should not exceed 250 mm (9.84 inches). Another series of lines perpendicular to the scan lines is laid out to create a grid with the scan lines. If the whole interior of the test material is to be inspected, the distance between these lines should not exceed 100 mm (3.93 inches). The antenna is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the scan lines, and data are recorded at each grid point along each scan line. After taking data along the first scan line, the operator moves to the beginning of the next scan line. The testing layout entered into the system is used during image reconstruction to establish the locations of the reflecting interfaces within the material. Figure 4 shows data collection with an ultrasonic tomographer.Source: FHWA.Figure 4. Photo. Data collection using an ultrasonic tomographer.Data ProcessingAfter all the data are acquired at a test location, SAFT is used to reconstruct a 2D image of the interior of the concrete member at the test location that represents the locations of reflecting interfaces in the region below the transducers. At the completion of testing, data for the 2D images obtained and stored in the UST at each test location can be transferred to a laptop computer that contains three-dimensional (3D) visualization software. The software integrates the 2D images to create a 3D model of the test material. Figure 5 illustrates a reconstructed 3D model. The user can manipulate the 3D model by rotating it or looking at different orthogonal planes cutting through the model. A C-scan shows the reflecting interfaces on a plane parallel to the test surface and at different depths (z-axis); that is, it provides a plan view of the reflectors. A B-scan provides an end view of the reflectors. The B-scan views are the same images created at each test location by the tomographer. A D-scan provides a side view of the reflectors. The user can look at specific slices of the 3D model by defining the z-coordinate for a C-scan image, the y‑coordinate for a B-scan image, and the x-coordinate for a D-scan image.© 2018 Acoustic Control System—ACS Group, Germany.Figure 5. Illustration. B-, C-, and D-scans.Data InterpretationThe 3D model, along with different plane sections (B-, C-, and D-scans), can be used to interpret data. A color template is used to describe features depending on the strength of reflection of ultrasonic waves. In most cases, low reflectivity is described using cold colors (blues and greens), while high reflectivity is described using hot colors (reds and yellows). High reflectivity, in most cases, indicates the presence of objects and discontinuities, such as reinforcements, cracks, delaminations, and voids. Low reflectivity, in most cases, indicates a sound condition. Figure 6 shows a typical B-scan as viewed in the equipment display. Several types of features and defects encountered during the inspection are indicated.© 2013 TRB.1 mm = 0.039 inches.Figure 6. Composite graph. Typical B-scans showing backwall and delamination.(5)The following are guidelines for interpreting data for common defects and features:Element thickness—Measuring the thickness of an element is based on the evaluation of the travel time of a pulse of ultrasonic waves reflected from the bottom surface of the layer. To get a clear reflection from the bottom surface, a strong contrast in acoustic impedances of the element material and material below the bottom surface is necessary. In the left side of figure 6, the bottom surface (backwall) is identified by a high-amplitude reflection in red. The horizontal shape of the reflection indicates the constant thickness of the element.Reinforcements, conduits, tendons, etc.—Cable-like objects are identified as localized high-intensity reflections, as shown in figure 6. Similar to thickness detection, there must be a contrast in acoustic impedances of the concrete and objects. The most effective way to detect the objects is by scanning perpendicular to the direction of their layout. A single scan will identify a linear object as a circular or oval high-amplitude region. The position and orientation of a linear object are defined from numerous parallel scans across the object. It is generally not possible to identify the material type. Examining the phase of the reflection can provide some insight on whether the reflector is of acoustic impedance higher or lower than the surrounding material. Rebars are most commonly recognized by a regular spacing between detected objects.Delamination—Similar to the detection of element thickness, delamination is identified as a high-amplitude linear reflection shallower than the actual thickness. Since delamination is often a curved and inclined surface, it may appear as a linear object with variable depths, as illustrated in figure 6. Since a delamination prevents propagation of ultrasonic waves below it, the bottom surface is not visible at delamination locations. Instead, ultrasonic waves are trapped between the delamination and top surface, which may result in multiple equally spaced reflections with depth in a B-scan.Air- and water-filled voids—Voids appear as high-amplitude reflections of a finite size. Because both air- and water-filled voids have lower acoustic impedances than concrete, it is nearly impossible to determine whether a void is filled with water.AdvantagesAdvantages of UST include the following:Reliable, repeatable, and consistent results.Real-time data collection and processing.Detailed 2D and 3D images.Multiple applications (determination of layer thickness and rebar location and flaw detection).Low to medium level of expertise required for equipment setup and data collection with modern equipment.LimitationsLimitations of UST include the following:Slow data collection.Difficult to detect additional reinforcement below two layers of reinforcement.Considerable engineering judgment required to properly evaluate a measurement.Possible misinterpretation when poor contact is made.Only works with cold and stiff asphalt pavements.Measurement has a limited ability to provide the degree of severity and cannot measure pavement condition below the top of the discontinuity.ReferencesHoegh K., Khazanovich L., and Yu, H.T.

Visual Inspection,"Bridge - Visual InspectionTarget of investigationsVisual inspection is beneficial in identifying wood defects such as intermediate and advanced stages of decay, water damage, modified members, mechanical damage, and failed members. Examples of common defects are briefly as follows:Fruiting bodiesThe presence of fruiting bodies, a positive indication of fungal attack, can indicate substantial decay in wood members. While some fungi species generate fruiting bodies after a minor decay, others may produce fruiting bodies after a substantial decay level. Fruiting bodies can be developed when the untreated wood grains are exposed to water [1].Figure 1. Fruiting body at the interface of beams [1].Surface depressions/ sunken surface or localized collapseThe presence of surface depressions can indicate the internal decay of wood members. Decay can generate voids or pockets near the surface of wood, leaving a thin intact/partially intact layer at the surface [1]. As a result of loss in strength and load-bearing capacity, the surface of decayed members may sink when subjected to external loading. Furthermore, the localized crush of a member can indicate a substantial decay [1].Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 2. A scenario leading to the surface depressions of a wood member [1].Staining and discolorationStaining and discoloration of wood indicate water exposure, and potentially high-moisture areas favorable for decay. The rust stains from metal fasteners can also indicate high-moisture areas due to wetting [1].Insect activityThe presence of holes, wood powder (frass), and insects can indicate wood damage due to insect activity. Decay can make wood attractive to insects such as carpenter ants [1].Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 3. Damage to a wood pile by carpenter ants [1]. The member was initially deteriorated by decay, which attracted carpenter ants.Plant and moss growthPlant/Moss growth in the checks and splits of wood members can indicate high moisture levels for a sustained period. Such conditions support fungal decay [1].Missing membersMissing members refer to the conditions where part or entire structural members are removed [1].Splits and checksSplits and checks can indicate a weakened member. While the depth of checks varies, splits extend through a member cross-section. These defects of sufficient depth can lead to the deterioration of the inner untreated section of a member through absorbing moisture and subsequent fungal decay.Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service.Figure 4. Photo. Large timber member treated with preservatives, which have only penetrated a certain depth of the member (darker color).(1)AlterationsAlterations/modifications of structural members can weaken wood members.1DescriptionVisual inspection is the simplest and most commonly used method for evaluating the wood condition. It requires a sufficient light source and is useful for detecting intermediate or advanced surface decay, water damage, mechanical damage, or failed members. During visual inspection, an inspector looks for evidence of decay or damage to wood members, noting areas that require further investigation.Physical PrincipleFor visual inspection, sufficient light needs to be reflected from the objects to an inspector’s eyes.Data AcquisitionAs a part of visual inspection, an inspector may perform routine and in-depth inspections. The routine inspection involves reviewing previous reports and visually inspecting members from beneath a bridge, locating obvious decay and damage. On the other hand, indepth inspections require a closer look at one or several members to identify defects that cannot be easily detected during a routine inspection. During the indepth inspection, a hands-on inspection may be performed. Bridge members may be inspected from distances less than an arm’s length away. Visual inspection may be accompanied by other nondestructive evaluation technologies to quantify the extent of the defects.2>Data ProcessingNo data processing is requiredData InterpretationTo identify the potential source of decay, an inspector compares the defects in the field with known types of defects (e.g., target of investigation section).AdvantagesAdvantages of visual inspection include the following:Rapid and well-established field inspection techniqueSimpleLow costLimitationsSome of the limitations of visual inspection include the following:Sufficient light and experience is required.Identification of decay is difficult at early stages when remedial treatments can be effective to prolong the service life of a member.(1)Quantitative information about the mechanical and physical properties of members is not provided.References1.
